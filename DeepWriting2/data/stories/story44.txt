There was once a turtle who lived among a great many people of different kinds , in a large camp near a big river which was born right up amongst the snows , and flowed straight away south till it reached a sea where the water was always hot .
There were many other turtles in the camp , and this turtle was kind and pleasant to them all , but he did not care for any of them very much , and felt rather lonely .
At last he built himself a hut , and filled it with skins for seats , and made it as comfortable as any hut for miles round ; and when it was quite finished he looked about among the young women to see which of them he should ask to be his wife .
It took him some time to make up his mind , for no turtle likes being hurried , but at length he found one girl who seemed prettier and more industrious than the rest , and one day he entered her home , and said : ` Will you marry me ? '
The young woman was so surprised at this question that she dropped the beaded slipper she was making , and stared at the turtle .
She felt inclined to laugh -- the idea was so absurd ; but she was kind-hearted and polite , so she looked as grave as she could , and answered : ` But how are you going to provide for a family ?
Why , when the camp moves , you will not even be able to keep up with the rest ! ' '
I can keep up with the best of them , ' replied the turtle , tossing his head .
But though he was very much offended he did not let the girl see it , and begged and , prayed her so hard to marry him that , at last , she consented , very unwillingly .
` You will have to wait till the spring , though , ' she said ; ' I must make a great many slippers and dresses for myself , as I shall not have much time afterwards . '
This did not please the turtle ; but he knew it was no use talking , so all he answered was : ' I shall go to war and take some captives , and I shall be away several months .
And when I return I shall expect you to be ready to marry me . '
So he went back to his hut , and at once set about his preparations .
The first thing he did was to call all his relations together , and ask them if they would come with him and make war on the people of a neighbouring village .
The turtles , who were tired of doing nothing , agreed at once , and next day the whole tribe left the camp .
The girl was standing at the door of her hut as they passed , and laughed out loud -- they moved so slowly .
Her lover , who was marching at the head , grew very angry at this , and cried out : ` In four days from now you will be weeping instead of laughing , because there will be hundreds of miles between you and me . '
` In four days , ' replied the girl -- who only promised to marry him in order to get rid of him -- ` in four days you will hardly be out of sight . '
` Oh , I did not mean four days , but four YEARS , ' answered the turtle , hastily ; ` whatever happens I shall be back by then . '
The army marched on , till one day , when they felt as if they must have got half round the earth , though they were scarcely four miles from the camp , they found a large tree lying across their path .
They looked at it with dismay , and the oldest among them put their heads together to see what was to be done .
` Can't we manage to get past by the top ? '
asked one .
` Why , it would take us YEARS , ' exclaimed another .
` Just look at all those tall green branches , spreading in every direction .
If once we got entangled in THEM , we should never get out again ! '
` Well then , let us go round by the bottom , ' said a third .
` How are we to do that , when the roots have made a deep hole , and above that is a high bank ? '
replied a fourth .
` No ; the only way I can think of , is to burn a large hole in the trunk . '
And this they did , but the trunk was very thick , and would not burn through .
` It is no use , we must give it up , ' they agreed at last .
` After all , nobody need ever know !
We have been away such a long while that we might easily have had all sorts of adventures . '
And so the whole company turned homewards again .
They took even longer to go back than they had to come , for they were tired and footsore with their journey .
When they drew near the camp they plucked up their courage , and began to sing a war-song .
At this the villagers came flocking to see what spoils the turtles had won , but , as they approached , each turtle seized some one by the wrist , exclaiming : ` You are our spoils ; you are our prisoners ! '
` Now that I have got you I will keep you , ' said the leader , who had happened to seize his betrothed .
Everybody was naturally very angry at this behaviour , and the girl most of all , and in her secret heart she determined to have her revenge .
But , just at present , the turtles were too strong , so the prisoners had to put on their smartest slippers and their brightest clothes , and dance a war dance while the turtles sang .
They danced so long that it seemed as if they would never stop , till the turtle who was leading the singing suddenly broke into a loud chant : Whoever comes here , will die , will die !
At this all the dancers grew so frightened that they burst through the ring of their captors , and ran back to the village , the turtles following -- very slowly .
On the way the chief turtle met a man , who said to him : ` That woman who was to have been your wife has married another man ! '
` Is that true ? '
said the turtle .
` Then I must see him . '
But as soon as the villager was out of sight the turtle stopped , and taking a bundle containing fringes and ornaments from his back , he hung them about him , so that they rattled as he walked .
When he was quite close to the hut where the woman lived , he cried out : ` Here I am to claim the woman who promised to be my wife . '
` Oh , here is the turtle , ' whispered the husband hurriedly ; ` what is to be done now ? '
` Leave that to me ; I will manage him , ' replied the wife , and at that moment the turtle came in , and seized her by the wrist .
` Come with me , ' he said sternly .
` You broke your promise , ' answered she .
` You said you would be back soon , and it is more than a year since you went !
How was I to know that you were alive ? '
At her words the husband took courage , and spoke hastily : ` Yes , you promised you would go to war and bring back some prisoners , and you have not done it . ' '
I DID go , and made many prisoners , ' retorted the turtle angrily , drawing out his knife .
` Look here , if she won't be MY wife , she sha n't be YOURS .
I will cut her in two ; and you shall have one half , and I the other . '
` But half a woman is no use to me , ' answered the man .
` If you want her so much you had better take her . '
And the turtle , followed by his relations , carried her off to his own hut .
Now the woman saw she would gain nothing by being sulky , so she pretended to be very glad to have got rid of her husband ; but all the while she was trying to invent a plan to deliver herself from the turtle .
At length she remembered that one of her friends had a large iron pot , and when the turtle had gone to his room to put away his fringes , she ran over to her neighbour's and brought it back .
Then she filled it with water and hung it over the fire to boil .
It was just beginning to bubble and hiss when the turtle entered .
` What are you doing there ? '
asked he , for he was always afraid of things that he did not understand .
` Just warming some water , ' she answered .
` Do you know how to swim ? '
` Yes , of course I do .
What a question !
But what does it matter to you ? '
said the turtle , more suspicious than ever .
` Oh , I only thought that after your long journey you might like to wash .
The roads are so muddy , after the winter's rains .
I could rub your shell for you till it was bright and shining again .
` Well , I AM rather muddy .
If one is fighting , you know , one can not stop to pick one's way .
I should certainly be more comfortable if my back was washed . '
The woman did not wait for him to change his mind .
She caught him up by his shell and popped him straight into the pot , where he sank to the bottom , and died instantly .
The other turtles , who were standing at the door , saw their leader disappear , and felt it was their duty as soldiers to follow him ; and , springing into the pot , died too .
All but one young turtle , who , frightened at not seeing any of his friends come out again , went as fast as he could to a clump of bushes , and from there made his way to the river .
His only thought was to get away as far as possible from that dreadful hut ; so he let the river carry him where it was going itself , and at last , one day , he found himself in the warm sea , where , if he is not dead , you may meet him still .
