`` Auntie , I have something to tell you , '' said Lina , with a blush that made her look more than ever like one of the climbing roses that nodded about the windows of the `` old Churchill place , '' as it was always called in Lower Wentworth .
Miss Madeline , sitting in the low rocker by the parlour window , seemed like the presiding genius of the place .
Everything about her matched her sweet old-fashionedness , from the crown of her soft brown hair , dressed in the style of her long ago girlhood , to the toes of her daintily slippered feet .
Outside of the old Churchill place , in the busy streets of the up-to-date little town , Miss Madeline might have seemed out of harmony with her surroundings .
But here , in this dim room , faintly scented with whiffs from the rose garden outside , she was like a note in some sweet , perfect melody of old time .
Lina , sitting on a little stool at Miss Madeline's feet with her curly head in her aunt's lap , was as pretty as Miss Madeline herself had once been .
She was also very happy , and her happiness seemed to envelop her as in an atmosphere and lend her a new radiance and charm .
Miss Madeline loved her pretty niece very dearly and patted the curly head tenderly with her slender white hands .
`` What is it , my dear ? ''
`` I 'm -- I 'm engaged , '' whispered Lina , hiding her face in Miss Madeline's flowered muslin lap .
`` Engaged ! ''
Miss Madeline's tone was one of surprise and awe .
She blushed as she said the word as deeply as Lina had done .
Then she went on , with a little quiver of excitement in her voice , `` To whom , my dear ? ''
`` Oh , you don't know him , Auntie , but I hope you will soon .
His name is Ralph Wylde .
Isn't it pretty ?
I met him last winter , and we became very good friends .
But we had a quarrel before I came down here and , oh , I have been so unhappy over it .
Three weeks ago he wrote me and begged my pardon -- so nice of him , because I was really all to blame , you know .
And he said he loved me and -- all that , you know . ''
`` No , I don't know , '' said Miss Madeline gently .
`` But -- but -- I can imagine . ''
`` Oh , I was so happy .
I wrote back and I had this letter from him today .
He is coming down tomorrow .
You'll be glad to see him , won't you , Auntie ? ''
`` Oh , yes , my dear , and I am glad for your sake -- very glad .
You are sure you love him ? ''
`` Yes , indeed , '' said Lina , with a little laugh , as if wondering how anyone could doubt it .
Presently , Miss Madeline said in a shy voice , `` Lina , did -- did you ever receive a proposal of marriage from anybody besides Mr. Wylde ? ''
Lina laughed roguishly .
`` Why , yes , Auntie , ever so many .
A dozen , at least . ''
`` Oh , my dear ! ''
cried Miss Madeline in a slightly shocked tone .
`` But I did , really .
Sometimes it was horrid and sometimes it was funny .
It all depended on the man .
Dear me , how red and uncomfortable most of them looked -- all but the fifth .
He was so cool and business like that he almost surprised me into accepting him . ''
`` And -- and what did you feel like , Lina ? ''
`` Oh , frightened , mostly -- but I always wanted to laugh too .
You must know how it is yourself , Auntie .
What did you feel like when somebody proposed to you ? ''
Miss Madeline flushed from chin to brow .
`` Oh , Lina , '' she faltered as if she were confessing something very disgraceful , yet to which she was impelled by her strict truthfulness , `` I -- I -- never had a proposal in my life -- not one . ''
Lina opened her big brown eyes in amazement .
`` Why , Aunt Madeline !
And you so pretty !
What was the reason ? ''
`` I've often wondered , '' said Miss Madeline faintly .
`` I was pretty , as you say -- it's so long ago I can say that now .
And I had many gentlemen friends .
But nobody ever wanted to marry me .
I sometimes wish that -- that I could have had just one proposal .
Not that I wanted to marry , you know , I do not mean that , but just so that it wouldn't have seemed that I was different from anybody else .
It is very foolish of me to wish it , I know , and even wicked -- for if I had not cared for the person it would have made him very unhappy .
But then , he would have forgotten and I would have remembered .
It would always have been something to be a little proud of . ''
`` Yes , '' said Lina absently ; her thoughts had gone back to Ralph .
That evening a letter was left at the front door of the old Churchill place .
It was addressed in a scholarly hand to Miss Madeline Churchill , and Amelia Kent took it in .
Amelia had been Miss Madeline's `` help '' for years and had grown grey in her service .
In Amelia's loyal eyes Miss Madeline was still young and beautiful ; she never doubted that the letter was for her mistress .
Nobody else there was ever addressed as `` Miss Madeline . ''
Miss Madeline was sitting by the window of her own room watching the sunset through the elms and reading her evening portion of Thomas à Kempis .
She never liked to be disturbed when so employed but she read her letter after Amelia had gone out .
When she came to a certain paragraph , she turned very pale and Thomas à Kempis fell to the floor unheeded .
When she had finished the letter she laid it on her lap , clasped her hands , and said , `` Oh , oh , oh , '' in a faint , tremulous voice .
Her cheeks were very pink and her eyes very bright .
She did not even pick up Thomas à Kempis but went to the door and called Lina .
`` What is it , Auntie ? ''
asked Lina curiously , noticing the signs of unusual excitement about Miss Madeline .
Miss Madeline held out her letter with a trembling hand .
`` Lina , dear , this is a letter from the Rev. Cecil Thorne .
It -- it is -- a proposal of marriage .
I feel terribly upset .
How very strange that it should come so soon after our talk this morning !
I want you to read it !
Perhaps I ought not to show it to anyone -- but I would like you to see it . ''
Lina took the letter and read it through .
It was unmistakably a proposal of marriage and was , moreover , a very charming epistle of its kind , albeit a little stiff and old-fashioned .
`` How funny ! ''
said Lina when she came to the end .
`` Funny ! ''
exclaimed Miss Madeline , with a trace of indignation in her gentle voice .
`` Oh , I didn't mean that the letter was funny , '' Lina hastened to explain , `` only that , as you said , it is odd to think of it coming so soon after our talk . ''
But this was a little fib on Lina's part .
She had thought that the letter or , rather , the fact that it had been written to Miss Madeline , funny .
The Rev. Cecil Thorne was Miss Madeline's pastor .
He was a handsome , scholarly man of middle age , and Lina had seen a good deal of him during her summer in Lower Wentworth .
She had taught the infant class in Sunday School and sometimes she had thought that the minister was in love with her .
But she must have been mistaken , she reflected ; it must have been her aunt after all , and the Rev. Cecil Thorne's shyly displayed interest in her must have been purely professional .
`` What a goose I was to be afraid he was in love with me ! ''
she thought .
Aloud she said , `` He says he will call tomorrow evening to receive your answer . ''
`` And , oh , what can I say to him ? ''
murmured Miss Madeline in dismay .
She wished she had a little of Lina's experience .
`` You are going to -- you will accept him , won't you ? ''
asked Lina curiously .
`` Oh , my dear , no ! ''
cried Miss Madeline almost vehemently .
`` I couldn't think of such a thing .
I am very sorry ; do you think he will feel badly ? ''
`` Judging from his letter I feel sure he will , '' said Lina decidedly .
Miss Madeline sighed .
`` Oh , dear me !
It is very unpleasant .
But of course I must refuse him .
What a beautiful letter he writes too .
I feel very much disturbed by this . ''
Miss Madeline picked up Thomas à Kempis , smoothed him out repentantly , and placed the letter between his leaves .
* * * * * When the Rev. Cecil Thorne called at the old Churchill place next evening at sunset and asked for Miss Madeline Churchill , Amelia showed him into the parlour and went to call her mistress .
Mr. Thorne sat down by the window that looked out on the lawn .
His heart gave a bound as he caught a glimpse of an airy white muslin among the trees and a ripple of distant laughter .
The next minute Lina appeared , strolling down the secluded path that curved about the birches .
A young man was walking beside her with his arm around her .
They crossed the green square before the house and disappeared in the rose garden .
Mr. Thorne leaned back in his chair and put his hand over his eyes .
He felt that he had received his answer , and it was a very bitter moment for him .
He had hardly dared hope that this bright , beautiful child could care for him , yet the realization came home to him none the less keenly .
When Miss Madeline , paling and flushing by turns , came shyly in he had recovered his self-control sufficiently to be able to say `` good evening '' in a calm voice .
Miss Madeline sat down opposite to him .
At that moment she was devoutly thankful that she had never had any other proposal to refuse .
It was a dreadful ordeal .
If he would only help her out !
But he did not speak and every moment of silence made it worse .
`` I -- received your letter , Mr. Thorne , '' she faltered at last , looking distressfully down at the floor .
`` My letter ! ''
Mr. Thorne turned towards her .
In her agitation Miss Madeline did not notice the surprise in his face and tone .
`` Yes , '' she said , gaining a little courage since the ice was broken .
`` It -- it -- was a very great surprise to me .
I never thought you -- you cared for me as -- as you said .
And I am very sorry because -- because I can not return your affection .
And so , of course , I can not marry you . ''
Mr. Thorne put his hand over his eyes again .
He understood now that there had been some mistake and that Miss Madeline had received the letter he had written to her niece .
Well , it did not matter -- the appearance of the young man in the garden had settled that .
Would he tell Miss Madeline of her mistake ?
No , it would only humiliate her and it made no difference , since she had refused him .
`` I suppose it is of no use to ask you to reconsider your decision ? ''
he said .
`` Oh , no , '' cried Miss Madeline almost aghast .
She was afraid he might ask it after all .
`` Not in the least use .
I am sorry -- so very sorry -- but I could not answer differently .
We -- I hope -- this will make no difference in our friendly relations , Mr. Thorne ? ''
`` Not at all , '' said Mr. Thorne gravely .
`` We will try to forget that it has happened . ''
He bowed sadly and went out .
Miss Madeline watched him guiltily as he walked across the lawn .
He looked heart-broken .
How dreadful it had been !
And Lina had refused twelve men !
How could she have lived through it ?
`` Perhaps one gets accustomed to doing it , '' reflected Miss Madeline .
`` But I am sure I never could . ''
`` Did Mr. Thorne feel very badly ? ''
whispered Lina that night .
`` I 'm afraid he did , '' confessed Miss Madeline sorrowfully .
`` He looked so pale and sad , Lina , that my heart ached for him .
I am very thankful that I have never had any other proposals to decline .
It is a very unpleasant experience .
But , '' she added , with a little tinge of satisfaction in her sweet voice , `` I am glad I had one .
It -- it has made me feel more like other people , you know , dear . ''
