Once upon a time what happened did happen , and if it had not happened this story would never have been told .
On the outskirts of a village just where the oxen were turned out to pasture , and the pigs roamed about burrowing with their noses among the roots of the trees , there stood a small house .
In the house lived a man who had a wife , and the wife was sad all day long .
` Dear wife , what is wrong with you that you hang your head like a drooping rosebud ? '
asked her husband one morning .
` You have everything you want ; why can not you be merry like other women ? '
` Leave me alone , and do not seek to know the reason , ' replied she , bursting into tears , and the man thought that it was no time to question her , and went away to his work .
He could not , however , forget all about it , and a few days after he inquired again the reason of her sadness , but only got the same reply .
At length he felt he could bear it no longer , and tried a third time , and then his wife turned and answered him .
` Good gracious ! '
cried she , ` why can not you let things be as they are ?
If I were to tell you , you would become just as wretched as myself .
If you would only believe , it is far better for you to know nothing . '
But no man yet was ever content with such an answer .
The more you beg him not to inquire , the greater is his curiosity to learn the whole .
` Well , if you MUST know , ' said the wife at last , ' I will tell you .
There is no luck in this house -- no luck at all ! '
` Is not your cow the best milker in all the village ?
Are not your trees as full of fruit as your hives are full of bees ?
Has anyone cornfields like ours ?
Really you talk nonsense when you say things like that ! '
` Yes , all that you say is true , but we have no children . '
Then Stan understood , and when a man once understands and has his eyes opened it is no longer well with him .
From that day the little house in the outskirts contained an unhappy man as well as an unhappy woman .
And at the sight of her husband's misery the woman became more wretched than ever .
And so matters went on for some time .
Some weeks had passed , and Stan thought he would consult a wise man who lived a day's journey from his own house .
The wise man was sitting before his door when he came up , and Stan fell on his knees before him .
` Give me children , my lord , give me children . '
` Take care what you are asking , ' replied the wise man .
` Will not children be a burden to you ?
Are you rich enough to feed and clothe them ? '
` Only give them to me , my lord , and I will manage somehow ! '
and at a sign from the wise man Stan went his way .
He reached home that evening tired and dusty , but with hope in his heart .
As he drew near his house a sound of voices struck upon his ear , and he looked up to see the whole place full of children .
Children in the garden , children in the yard , children looking out of every window -- it seemed to the man as if all the children in the world must be gathered there .
And none was bigger than the other , but each was smaller than the other , and every one was more noisy and more impudent and more daring than the rest , and Stan gazed and grew cold with horror as he realised that they all belonged to him .
` Good gracious !
how many there are !
how many ! '
he muttered to himself .
` Oh , but not one too many , ' smiled his wife , coming up with a crowd more children clinging to her skirts .
But even she found that it was not so easy to look after a hundred children , and when a few days had passed and they had eaten up all the food there was in the house , they began to cry , ` Father !
I am hungry -- I am hungry , ' till Stan scratched his head and wondered what he was to do next .
It was not that he thought there were too many children , for his life had seemed more full of joy since they appeared , but now it came to the point he did not know how he was to feed them .
The cow had ceased to give milk , and it was too early for the fruit trees to ripen .
` Do you know , old woman ! '
said he one day to his wife , ' I must go out into the world and try to bring back food somehow , though I can not tell where it is to come from . '
To the hungry man any road is long , and then there was always the thought that he had to satisfy a hundred greedy children as well as himself .
Stan wandered , and wandered , and wandered , till he reached to the end of the world , where that which is , is mingled with that which is not , and there he saw , a little way off , a sheepfold , with seven sheep in it .
In the shadow of some trees lay the rest of the flock .
Stan crept up , hoping that he might manage to decoy some of them away quietly , and drive them home for food for his family , but he soon found this could not be .
For at midnight he heard a rushing noise , and through the air flew a dragon , who drove apart a ram , a sheep , and a lamb , and three fine cattle that were lying down close by .
And besides these he took the milk of seventy-seven sheep , and carried it home to his old mother , that she might bathe in it and grow young again .
And this happened every night .
The shepherd bewailed himself in vain : the dragon only laughed , and Stan saw that this was not the place to get food for his family .
But though he quite understood that it was almost hopeless to fight against such a powerful monster , yet the thought of the hungry children at home clung to him like a burr , and would not be shaken off , and at last he said to the shepherd , ` What will you give me if I rid you of the dragon ? '
` One of every three rams , one of every three sheep , one of every three lambs , ' answered the herd .
` It is a bargain , ' replied Stan , though at the moment he did not know how , supposing he DID come off the victor , he would ever be able to drive so large a flock home .
However , that matter could be settled later .
At present night was not far off , and he must consider how best to fight with the dragon .
Just at midnight , a horrible feeling that was new and strange to him came over Stan -- a feeling that he could not put into words even to himself , but which almost forced him to give up the battle and take the shortest road home again .
He half turned ; then he remembered the children , and turned back .
` You or I , ' said Stan to himself , and took up his position on the edge of the flock .
` Stop ! '
he suddenly cried , as the air was filled with a rushing noise , and the dragon came dashing past .
` Dear me ! '
exclaimed the dragon , looking round .
` Who are you , and where do you come from ? ' '
I am Stan Bolovan , who eats rocks all night , and in the day feeds on the flowers of the mountain ; and if you meddle with those sheep I will carve a cross on your back . '
When the dragon heard these words he stood quite still in the middle of the road , for he knew he had met with his match .
` But you will have to fight me first , ' he said in a trembling voice , for when you faced him properly he was not brave at all . '
I fight you ? '
replied Stan , ` why I could slay you with one breath ! '
Then , stooping to pick up a large cheese which lay at his feet , he added , ` Go and get a stone like this out of the river , so that we may lose no time in seeing who is the best man . '
The dragon did as Stan bade him , and brought back a stone out of the brook .
` Can you get buttermilk out of your stone ? '
asked Stan .
The dragon picked up his stone with one hand , and squeezed it till it fell into powder , but no buttermilk flowed from it .
` Of course I can't ! '
he said , half angrily .
` Well , if you can't , I can , ' answered Stan , and he pressed the cheese till buttermilk flowed through his fingers .
When the dragon saw that , he thought it was time he made the best of his way home again , but Stan stood in his path .
` We have still some accounts to settle , ' said he , ` about what you have been doing here , ' and the poor dragon was too frightened to stir , lest Stan should slay him at one breath and bury him among the flowers in the mountain pastures .
` Listen to me , ' he said at last . '
I see you are a very useful person , and my mother has need of a fellow like you .
Suppose you enter her service for three days , which are as long as one of your years , and she will pay you each day seven sacks full of ducats . '
Three times seven sacks full of ducats !
The offer was very tempting , and Stan could not resist it .
He did not waste words , but nodded to the dragon , and they started along the road .
It was a long , long way , but when they came to the end they found the dragon's mother , who was as old as time itself , expecting them .
Stan saw her eyes shining like lamps from afar , and when they entered the house they beheld a huge kettle standing on the fire , filled with milk .
When the old mother found that her son had arrived empty-handed she grew very angry , and fire and flame darted from her nostrils , but before she could speak the dragon turned to Stan .
` Stay here , ' said he , ` and wait for me ; I am going to explain things to my mother . '
Stan was already repenting bitterly that he had ever come to such a place , but , since he was there , there was nothing for it but to take everything quietly , and not show that he was afraid .
` Listen , mother , ' said the dragon as soon as they were alone , ' I have brought this man in order to get rid of him .
He is a terrific fellow who eats rocks , and can press buttermilk out of a stone , ' and he told her all that had happened the night before .
` Oh , just leave him to me ! '
she said . '
I have never yet let a man slip through my fingers . '
So Stan had to stay and do the old mother service .
The next day she told him that he and her son should try which was the strongest , and she took down a huge club , bound seven times with iron .
The dragon picked it up as if it had been a feather , and , after whirling it round his head , flung it lightly three miles away , telling Stan to beat that if he could .
They walked to the spot where the club lay .
Stan stooped and felt it ; then a great fear came over him , for he knew that he and all his children together would never lift that club from the ground .
` What are you doing ? '
asked the dragon . '
I was thinking what a beautiful club it was , and what a pity it is that it should cause your death . '
` How do you mean -- my death ? '
asked the dragon .
` Only that I am afraid that if I throw it you will never see another dawn .
You don't know how strong I am ! '
` Oh , never mind that be quick and throw . '
` If you are really in earnest , let us go and feast for three days : that will at any rate give you three extra days of life . '
Stan spoke so calmly that this time the dragon began to get a little frightened , though he did not quite believe that things would be as bad as Stan said .
They returned to the house , took all the food that could be found in the old mother's larder , and carried it back to the place where the club was lying .
Then Stan seated himself on the sack of provisions , and remained quietly watching the setting moon .
` What are you doing ? '
asked the dragon .
` Waiting till the moon gets out of my way . '
` What do you mean ?
I don't understand . '
` Don't you see that the moon is exactly in my way ?
But of course , if you like , I will throw the club into the moon . '
At these words the dragon grew uncomfortable for the second time .
He prized the club , which had been left him by his grandfather , very highly , and had no desire that it should be lost in the moon .
` I'll tell you what , ' he said , after thinking a little .
` Don't throw the club at all .
I will throw it a second time , and that will do just as well . '
` No , certainly not ! '
replied Stan .
` Just wait till the moon sets . '
But the dragon , in dread lest Stan should fulfil his threats , tried what bribes could do , and in the end had to promise Stan seven sacks of ducats before he was suffered to throw back the club himself .
` Oh , dear me , that is indeed a strong man , ' said the dragon , turning to his mother .
` Would you believe that I have had the greatest difficulty in preventing him from throwing the club into the moon ? '
Then the old woman grew uncomfortable too !
Only to think of it !
It was no joke to throw things into the moon !
So no more was heard of the club , and the next day they had all something else to think about .
` Go and fetch me water ! '
said the mother , when the morning broke , and gave them twelve buffalo skins with the order to keep filling them till night .
They set out at once for the brook , and in the twinkling of an eye the dragon had filled the whole twelve , carried them into the house , and brought them back to Stan .
Stan was tired : he could scarcely lift the buckets when they were empty , and he shuddered to think of what would happen when they were full .
But he only took an old knife out of his pocket and began to scratch up the earth near the brook .
` What are you doing there ?
How are you going to carry the water into the house ? '
asked the dragon .
` How ?
Dear me , that is easy enough !
I shall just take the brook ! '
At these words the dragon's jaw dropped .
This was the last thing that had ever entered his head , for the brook had been as it was since the days of his grandfather .
` I'll tell you what ! '
he said .
` Let me carry your skins for you . '
` Most certainly not , ' answered Stan , going on with his digging , and the dragon , in dread lest he should fulfil his threat , tried what bribes would do , and in the end had again to promise seven sacks of ducats before Stan would agree to leave the brook alone and let him carry the water into the house .
On the third day the old mother sent Stan into the forest for wood , and , as usual , the dragon went with him .
Before you could count three he had pulled up more trees than Stan could have cut down in a lifetime , and had arranged them neatly in rows .
When the dragon had finished , Stan began to look about him , and , choosing the biggest of the trees , he climbed up it , and , breaking off a long rope of wild vine , bound the top of the tree to the one next it .
And so he did to a whole line of trees .
` What are you doing there ? '
asked the dragon .
` You can see for yourself , ' answered Stan , going quietly on with his work .
` Why are you tying the trees together ? '
` Not to give myself unnecessary work ; when I pull up one , all the others will come up too . '
` But how will you carry them home ? '
` Dear me !
don't you understand that I am going to take the whole forest back with me ? '
said Stan , tying two other trees as he spoke .
` I'll tell you what , ' cried the dragon , trembling with fear at the thought of such a thing ; ` let me carry the wood for you , and you shall have seven times seven sacks full of ducats . '
` You are a good fellow , and I agree to your proposal , ' answered Stan , and the dragon carried the wood .
Now the three days ' service which were to be reckoned as a year were over , and the only thing that disturbed Stan was , how to get all those ducats back to his home !
In the evening the dragon and his mother had a long talk , but Stan heard every word through a crack in the ceiling .
` Woe be to us , mother , ' said the dragon ; ` this man will soon get us into his power .
Give him his money , and let us be rid of him . '
But the old mother was fond of money , and did not like this .
` Listen to me , ' said she ; ` you must murder him this very night . ' '
I am afraid , ' answered he .
` There is nothing to fear , ' replied the old mother .
` When he is asleep take the club , and hit him on the head with it .
It is easily done . '
And so it would have been , had not Stan heard all about it .
And when the dragon and his mother had put out their lights , he took the pigs ' trough and filled it with earth , and placed it in his bed , and covered it with clothes .
Then he hid himself underneath , and began to snore loudly .
Very soon the dragon stole softly into the room , and gave a tremendous blow on the spot where Stan's head should have been .
Stan groaned loudly from under the bed , and the dragon went away as softly as he had come .
Directly he had closed the door , Stan lifted out the pigs ' trough , and lay down himself , after making everything clean and tidy , but he was wise enough not to shut his eyes that night .
The next morning he came into the room when the dragon and his mother were having their breakfast .
` Good morning , ' said he .
` Good morning .
How did you sleep ? '
` Oh , very well , but I dreamed that a flea had bitten me , and I seem to feel it still . '
The dragon and his mother looked at each other .
` Do you hear that ? '
whispered he .
` He talks of a flea .
I broke my club on his head . '
This time the mother grew as frightened as her son .
There was nothing to be done with a man like this , and she made all haste to fill the sacks with ducats , so as to get rid of Stan as soon as possible .
But on his side Stan was trembling like an aspen , as he could not lift even one sack from the ground .
So he stood still and looked at them .
` What are you standing there for ? '
asked the dragon .
` Oh , I was standing here because it has just occurred to me that I should like to stay in your service for another year .
I am ashamed that when I get home they should see I have brought back so little .
I know that they will cry out , `` Just look at Stan Bolovan , who in one year has grown as weak as a dragon . '' '
Here a shriek of dismay was heard both from the dragon and his mother , who declared they would give him seven or even seven times seven the number of sacks if he would only go away .
` I'll tell you what ! '
said Stan at last . '
I see you don't want me to stay , and I should be very sorry to make myself disagreeable .
I will go at once , but only on condition that you shall carry the money home yourself , so that I may not be put to shame before my friends . '
The words were hardly out of his mouth before the dragon had snatched up the sacks and piled them on his back .
Then he and Stan set forth .
The way , though really not far , was yet too long for Stan , but at length he heard his children's voices , and stopped short .
He did not wish the dragon to know where he lived , lest some day he should come to take back his treasure .
Was there nothing he could say to get rid of the monster ?
Suddenly an idea came into Stan's head , and he turned round . '
I hardly know what to do , ' said he . '
I have a hundred children , and I am afraid they may do you harm , as they are always ready for a fight .
However , I will do my best to protect you . '
A hundred children !
That was indeed no joke !
The dragon let fall the sacks from terror , and then picked them up again .
But the children , who had had nothing to eat since their father had left them , came rushing towards him , waving knives in their right hands and forks in their left , and crying , ` Give us dragon's flesh ; we will have dragon's flesh . '
At this dreadful sight the dragon waited no longer : he flung down his sacks where he stood and took flight as fast as he could , so terrified at the fate that awaited him that from that day he has never dared to show his face in the world again .
