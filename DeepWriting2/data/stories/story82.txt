Once upon a time there lived a man who dwelt with his wife in a little hut , far away from any neighbours .
But they did not mind being alone , and would have been quite happy , if it had not been for a marten , who came every night to their poultry yard , and carried off one of their fowls .
The man laid all sorts of traps to catch the thief , but instead of capturing the foe , it happened that one day he got caught himself , and falling down , struck his head against a stone , and was killed .
Not long after the marten came by on the look out for his supper .
Seeing the dead man lying there , he said to himself : ` That is a prize , this time I have done well ' ; and dragging the body with great difficulty to the sledge which was waiting for him , drove off with his booty .
He had not driven far when he met a squirrel , who bowed and said : ` Good-morning , godfather !
what have you got behind you ? '
The marten laughed and answered : ` Did you ever hear anything so strange ?
The old man that you see here set traps about his hen-house , thinking to catch me but he fell into his own trap , and broke his own neck .
He is very heavy ; I wish you would help me to draw the sledge . '
The squirrel did as he was asked , and the sledge moved slowly along .
By-and-by a hare came running across a field , but stopped to see what wonderful thing was coming .
` What have you got there ? '
she asked , and the marten told his story and begged the hare to help them pull .
The hare pulled her hardest , and after a while they were joined by a fox , and then by a wolf , and at length a bear was added to the company , and he was of more use than all the other five beasts put together .
Besides , when the whole six had supped off the man he was not so heavy to draw .
The worst of it was that they soon began to get hungry again , and the wolf , who was the hungriest of all , said to the rest : ` What shall we eat now , my friends , as there is no more man ? ' '
I suppose we shall have to eat the smallest of us , ' replied the bear , and the marten turned round to seize the squirrel who was much smaller than any of the rest .
But the squirrel ran up a tree like lightning , and the marten remembering , just in time , that he was the next in size , slipped quick as thought into a hole in the rocks .
` What shall we eat now ? '
asked the wolf again , when he had recovered from his surprise .
` We must eat the smallest of us , ' repeated the bear , stretching out a paw towards the hare ; but the hare was not a hare for nothing , and before the paw had touched her , she had darted deep into the wood .
Now that the squirrel , the marten , and the hare had all gone , the fox was the smallest of the three who were left , and the wolf and the bear explained that they were very sorry , but they would have to eat him .
Michael , the fox , did not run away as the others had done , but smiled in a friendly manner , and remarked : ` Things taste so stale in a valley ; one's appetite is so much better up on a mountain . '
The wolf and the bear agreed , and they turned out of the hollow where they had been walking , and chose a path that led up the mountain side .
The fox trotted cheerfully by his two big companions , but on the way he managed to whisper to the wolf : ` Tell me , Peter , when I am eaten , what will you have for your next dinner ? '
This simple question seemed to put out the wolf very much .
What would they have for their next dinner , and , what was more important still , who would there be to eat it ?
They had made a rule always to dine off the smallest of the party , and when the fox was gone , why of course , he was smaller than the bear .
These thoughts flashed quickly through his head , and he said hastily : ` Dear brothers , would it not be better for us to live together as comrades , and everyone to hunt for the common dinner ?
Is not my plan a good one ? '
` It is the best thing I have ever heard , ' answered the fox ; and as they were two to one the bear had to be content , though in his heart he would much have preferred a good dinner at once to any friendship .
For a few days all went well ; there was plenty of game in the forest , and even the wolf had as much to eat as he could wish .
One morning the fox as usual was going his rounds when he noticed a tall , slender tree , with a magpie's nest in one of the top branches .
Now the fox was particularly fond of young magpies , and he set about making a plan by which he could have one for dinner .
At last he hit upon something which he thought would do , and accordingly he sat down near the tree and began to stare hard at it .
` What are you looking at , Michael ? '
asked the magpie , who was watching him from a bough .
` I 'm looking at this tree .
It has just struck me what a good tree it would be to cut my new snow-shoes out of . '
But at this answer the magpie screeched loudly , and exclaimed : ` Oh , not this tree , dear brother , I implore you !
I have built my nest on it , and my young ones are not yet old enough to fly . '
` It will not be easy to find another tree that would make such good snow-shoes , ' answered the fox , cocking his head on one side , and gazing at the tree thoughtfully ; ` but I do not like to be ill-natured , so if you will give me one of your young ones I will seek my snow-shoes elsewhere . '
Not knowing what to do the poor magpie had to agree , and flying back , with a heavy heart , he threw one of his young ones out of the nest .
The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in triumph , while the magpie , though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one , found some comfort in the thought that only a bird of extraordinary wisdom would have dreamed of saving the rest by the sacrifice of the one .
But what do you think happened ?
Why , a few days later , Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same tree , and a dreadful pang shot through the heart of the magpie as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest .
` What are you looking at ? '
he asked in a trembling voice .
` At this tree .
I was just thinking what good snowshoes it would make , ' answered the fox in an absent voice , as if he was not thinking of what he was saying .
` Oh , my brother , my dear little brother , don't do that , ' cried the magpie , hopping about in his anguish .
` You know you promised only a few days ago that you would get your snow-shoes elsewhere . '
` So I did ; but though I have searched through the whole forest , there is not a single tree that is as good as this .
I am very sorry to put you out , but really it is not my fault .
The only thing I can do for you is to offer to give up my snow-shoes altogether if you will throw me down one of your young ones in exchange . '
And the poor magpie , in spite of his wisdom , was obliged to throw another of his little ones out of the nest ; and this time he was not able to console himself with the thought that he had been much cleverer than other people .
He sat on the edge of his nest , his head drooping and his feathers all ruffled , looking the picture of misery .
Indeed he was so different from the gay , jaunty magpie whom every creature in the forest knew , that a crow who was flying past , stopped to inquire what was the matter .
` Where are the two young ones who are not in the nest ? '
asked he . '
I had to give them to the fox , ' replied the magpie in a quivering voice ; ` he has been here twice in the last week , and wanted to cut down my tree for the purpose of making snow-shoes out of it , and the only way I could buy him off was by giving him two of my young ones . '
Oh , you fool , ' cried the crow , ` the fox was only trying to frighten you .
He could not have cut down the tree , for he has neither axe nor knife .
Dear me , to think that you have sacrificed your young ones for nothing !
Dear , dear !
how could you be so very foolish ! '
And the crow flew away , leaving the magpie overcome with shame and sorrow .
The next morning the fox came to his usual place in front of the tree , for he was hungry , and a nice young magpie would have suited him very well for dinner .
But this time there was no cowering , timid magpie to do his bidding , but a bird with his head erect and a determined voice .
` My good fox , ' said the magpie putting his head on one side and looking very wise -- ` my good fox , if you take my advice , you will go home as fast as you can .
There is no use your talking about making snow-shoes out of this tree , when you have neither knife nor axe to cut it down with ! '
` Who has been teaching you wisdom ? '
asked the fox , forgetting his manners in his surprise at this new turn of affairs .
` The crow , who paid me a visit yesterday , ' answered the magpie .
` The crow was it ? '
said the fox , ` well , the crow had better not meet me for the future , or it may be the worse for him . '
As Michael , the cunning beast , had no desire to continue the conversation , he left the forest ; but when he came to the high road he laid himself at full length on the ground , stretching himself out , just as if he was dead .
Very soon he noticed , out of the corner of his eye , that the crow was flying towards him , and he kept stiller and stiffer than ever , with his tongue hanging out of his mouth .
The crow , who wanted her supper very badly , hopped quickly towards him , and was stooping forward to peck at his tongue when the fox gave a snap , and caught him by the wing .
The crow knew that it was of no use struggling , so he said : ` Ah , brother , if you are really going to eat me , do it , I beg of you , in good style .
Throw me first over this precipice , so that my feathers may be strewn here and there , and that all who see them may know that your cunning is greater than mine . '
This idea pleased the fox , for he had not yet forgiven the crow for depriving him of the young magpies , so he carried the crow to the edge of the precipice and threw him over , intending to go round by a path he knew and pick him up at the bottom .
But no sooner had the fox let the crow go than he soared up into the air , and hovering just out of teach of his enemy's jaws , he cried with a laugh : ` Ah , fox !
you know well how to catch , but you can not keep . '
With his tail between his legs , the fox slunk into the forest .
He did not know where to look for a dinner , as he guessed that the crow would have flown back before him , and put every one on their guard .
The notion of going to bed supperless was very unpleasant to him , and he was wondering what in the world he should do , when he chanced to meet with his old friend the bear .
This poor animal had just lost his wife , and was going to get some one to mourn over her , for he felt her loss greatly .
He had hardly left his comfortable cave when he had come across the wolf , who inquired where he was going . '
I am going to find a mourner , ' answered the bear , and told his story .
` Oh , let me mourn for you , ' cried the wolf .
` Do you understand how to howl ? '
said the bear .
` Oh , certainly , godfather , certainly , ' replied the wolf ; but the bear said he should like to have a specimen of his howling , to make sure that he knew his business .
So the wolf broke forth in his song of lament : ` Hu , hu , hu , hum , hoh , ' he shouted , and he made such a noise that the bear put up his paws to his ears , and begged him to stop .
` You have no idea how it is done .
Be off with you , ' said he angrily .
A little further down the road the hare was resting in a ditch , but when she saw the bear , she came out and spoke to him , and inquired why he looked so sad .
The bear told her of the loss of his wife , and of his search after a mourner that could lament over her in the proper style .
The hare instantly offered her services , but the bear took care to ask her to give him a proof of her talents , before he accepted them .
` Pu , pu , pu , pum , poh , ' piped the hare ; but this time her voice was so small that the bear could hardly hear her .
` That is not what I want , ' he said , ' I will bid you good morning . '
It was after this that the fox came up , and he also was struck with the bear's altered looks , and stopped .
` What is the matter with you , godfather ? '
asked he , ` and where are you going ? ' '
I am going to find a mourner for my wife , ' answered the bear .
` Oh , do choose me , ' cried the fox , and the bear looked at him thoughtfully .
` Can you howl well ? '
he said .
` Yes , beautifully , just listen , ' and the fox lifted up his voice and sang weeping : ` Lou , lou , lou !
the famous spinner , the baker of good cakes , the prudent housekeeper is torn from her husband !
Lou , lou , lou !
she is gone !
she is gone ! '
` Now at last I have found some one who knows the art of lamentation , ' exclaimed the bear , quite delighted ; and he led the fox back to his cave , and bade him begin his lament over the dead wife who was lying stretched out on her bed of grey moss .
But this did not suit the fox at all .
` One can not wail properly in this cave , ' he said , ` it is much too damp .
You had better take the body to the storehouse .
It will sound much finer there . '
So the bear carried his wife's body to the storehouse , while he himself went back to the cave to cook some pap for the mourner .
From time to time he paused and listened for the sound of wailing , but he heard nothing .
At last he went to the door of the storehouse , and called to the fox : ` Why don't you howl , godfather ?
What are you about ? '
And the fox , who , instead of weeping over the dead bear , had been quietly eating her , answered : ` There only remain now her legs and the soles of her feet .
Give me five minutes more and they will be gone also ! '
When the bear heard that he ran back for the kitchen ladle , to give the traitor the beating he deserved .
But as he opened the door of the storehouse , Michael was ready for him , and slipping between his legs , dashed straight off into the forest .
The bear , seeing that the traitor had escaped , flung the ladle after him , and it just caught the tip of his tail , and that is how there comes to be a spot of white on the tails of all foxes .
