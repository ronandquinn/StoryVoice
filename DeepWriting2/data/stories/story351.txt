He stood on the sagging doorstep and looked out on the snowy world .
His hands were clasped behind him , and his thin face wore a thoughtful , puzzled look .
The door behind him opened jerkingly , and a scowling woman came out with a pan of dishwater in her hand .
`` Ain't you gone yet , Bert ? ''
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
`` It's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully .
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
`` Well , I never saw such laziness !
No wonder old Sampson won't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
Goodness , if I don't settle that boy ! ''
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he can't .
He hasn't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens .
It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run .
He shivered , and looked up at his aunt's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John .
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly .
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Don't be a goose . ''
`` It's all right , '' persisted Bertie .
`` I don't need them -- much .
And William John doesn't hardly ever get out . ''
He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself .
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures .
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes's handsome house .
His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes .
`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two .
`` He is almost frozen , I believe .
Why doesn't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
`` There she goes now , '' said Amy .
`` Edie , couldn't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?
He looks so cold . ''
And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie's parcels .
`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''
`` He's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently .
`` It won't hurt him . ''
`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''
Perhaps Edith's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go .
It's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest .
`` What's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''
`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round .
`` And you 're Sampson's errand boy just now ?
My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
`` I lent them to William John -- he hadn't any , '' faltered Bertie .
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
`` Why , I have three pairs .
And who is William John ? ''
`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie .
`` And he's awful sickly .
He wanted to go out to play , and he hadn't any mittens , so I lent him mine .
I didn't miss them -- much . ''
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We didn't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
said Amy , quite overcome .
`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year's instead . ''
Bertie shook his head .
`` No 'm , I guess not .
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
Edith understood better , and she changed the subject .
`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''
`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully .
`` I guess there's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door .
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own .
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
Goodbye , Bertie . ''
`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed .
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith .
`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten .
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm .
He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen .
And , oh , Papa , just think !
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
`` I've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''
`` He was so pretty , Papa .
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
`` Oh , a cousin or something , didn't he say Edie ?
Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens .
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
`` There are plenty who haven't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh .
`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year's night . ''
`` Oh , Papa ! ''
said Edith , her eyes shining like stars .
The doctor laughed .
`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question .
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
`` Is that you , Bert ? ''
She spoke sharply .
She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit .
`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap .
`` I s ` pose you've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross .
`` Sampson didn't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''
`` No .
He said he couldn't -- I asked him . ''
`` Well , I didn't expect he would .
You'll have a holiday on New Year's anyhow ; whether you'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
`` I've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John .
It's from Doctor Forbes's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove .
`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John couldn't go if he had ten invitations .
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he's laid up for a week .
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
`` Well , then , I won't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment .
`` I wouldn't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They wouldn't eat you .
But as I said , please yourself .
Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''
The caution came too late .
William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying .
`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''
`` I don't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John .
`` I heard you out there -- you needn't think I didn't .
Bertie's going to Doctor Forbes's to dinner and I can't go . ''
`` Well , you've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother .
`` If you hadn't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes's .
Little boys who won't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
Stop crying , now .
I dare say if Bertie goes they'll send you some candy , or something . ''
But William John refused to be comforted .
He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face .
`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''
`` I ain't any better , '' replied William John mournfully .
`` I s ` pose you'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''
`` Oh , I 'm not going since you can't , '' said Bertie cheerily .
He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect .
William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That's just what I expected .
I did s ` pose if I couldn't go you would , and tell me about it .
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
`` Come now , William John , don't be so cross .
I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I'll go , if you want me to . ''
`` Honest , now ? ''
`` Yes , honest .
I'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went .
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him .
`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy .
`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''
`` He couldn't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John .
`` He's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
`` Oh , dear me !
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
he said , giving Bertie's hand a hearty shake .
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John's non-appearance .
`` It's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire .
`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold couldn't catch you .
I suppose you'll soon be leaving Sampson's .
He told me he didn't need you after the holiday season was over .
What are you going at next ?
Have you anything in view ? ''
Bertie shook his head sorrowfully .
`` No , sir ; but , '' he added more cheerfully , `` I guess I'll find something if I hunt around lively .
I almost always do . ''
He forgot his shyness ; his face flushed hopefully , and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright , earnest eyes .
The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise .
But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts .
And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him !
He wondered whether he was dreaming .
`` And here's a picture-book for William John , '' said Amy , `` and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him .
Oh , there's the dinner-bell .
I 'm awfully hungry .
Papa says that is my ` normal condition , ' but I don't know what that means . ''
As for that dinner -- Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams , but certainly never out of them .
It was a feast to be dated from .
When the plum pudding came on , the doctor , who had been notably silent , leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and looked critically at Bertie .
`` So Mr. Sampson can't keep you ? ''
Bertie's face sobered at once .
He had almost forgotten his responsibilities .
`` No , sir .
He says I 'm too small for the heavy work . ''
`` Well , you are rather small -- but no doubt you will grow .
Boys have a queer habit of doing that .
I think you know how to make yourself useful .
I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse .
If you like , I'll try you .
You can live here , and go to school .
I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds , and the first good one that will suit you , I'll bespeak for you .
How will that do ? ''
`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice .
`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially .
`` Come on Monday then .
And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is .
Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''
`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie .
Pudding , indeed !
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go .
`` Off , are you ? ''
said the doctor , looking up from his paper .
`` Well , I'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''
`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily .
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John's present .
I've tied all the other things on so that they can't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said .
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
`` Thank you , '' said Bertie .
`` I've had a splendid time .
I'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise .
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
