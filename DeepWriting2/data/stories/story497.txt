NOT always was the Kangaroo as now we do behold him , but a Different Animal with four short legs .
He was grey and he was woolly , and his pride was inordinate : he danced on an outcrop in the middle of Australia , and he went to the Little God Nqa .
He went to Nqa at six before breakfast , saying , ` Make me different from all other animals by five this afternoon . '
Up jumped Nqa from his seat on the sandflat and shouted , ` Go away ! '
He was grey and he was woolly , and his pride was inordinate : he danced on a rock-ledge in the middle of Australia , and he went to the Middle God Nquing .
He went to Nquing at eight after breakfast , saying , ` Make me different from all other animals ; make me , also , wonderfully popular by five this afternoon . '
Up jumped Nquing from his burrow in the spinifex and shouted , ` Go away ! '
He was grey and he was woolly , and his pride was inordinate : he danced on a sandbank in the middle of Australia , and he went to the Big God Nqong .
He went to Nqong at ten before dinner-time , saying , ` Make me different from all other animals ; make me popular and wonderfully run after by five this afternoon . '
Up jumped Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan and shouted , ` Yes , I will ! '
Nqong called Dingo -- Yellow-Dog Dingo -- always hungry , dusty in the sunshine , and showed him Kangaroo .
Nqong said , ` Dingo !
Wake up , Dingo !
Do you see that gentleman dancing on an ashpit ?
He wants to be popular and very truly run after .
Dingo , make him SO ! '
Up jumped Dingo -- Yellow-Dog Dingo -- and said , ` What , that cat-rabbit ? '
Off ran Dingo -- Yellow-Dog Dingo -- always hungry , grinning like a coal-scuttle , -- ran after Kangaroo .
Off went the proud Kangaroo on his four little legs like a bunny .
This , O Beloved of mine , ends the first part of the tale !
He ran through the desert ; he ran through the mountains ; he ran through the salt-pans ; he ran through the reed-beds ; he ran through the blue gums ; he ran through the spinifex ; he ran till his front legs ached .
He had to !
Still ran Dingo -- Yellow-Dog Dingo -- always hungry , grinning like a rat-trap , never getting nearer , never getting farther , -- ran after Kangaroo .
He had to !
Still ran Kangaroo -- Old Man Kangaroo .
He ran through the ti-trees ; he ran through the mulga ; he ran through the long grass ; he ran through the short grass ; he ran through the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer ; he ran till his hind legs ached .
He had to !
Still ran Dingo -- Yellow-Dog Dingo -- hungrier and hungrier , grinning like a horse-collar , never getting nearer , never getting farther ; and they came to the Wollgong River .
Now , there wasn't any bridge , and there wasn't any ferry-boat , and Kangaroo didn't know how to get over ; so he stood on his legs and hopped .
He had to !
He hopped through the Flinders ; he hopped through the Cinders ; he hopped through the deserts in the middle of Australia .
He hopped like a Kangaroo .
First he hopped one yard ; then he hopped three yards ; then he hopped five yards ; his legs growing stronger ; his legs growing longer .
He hadn't any time for rest or refreshment , and he wanted them very much .
Still ran Dingo -- Yellow-Dog Dingo -- very much bewildered , very much hungry , and wondering what in the world or out of it made Old Man Kangaroo hop .
For he hopped like a cricket ; like a pea in a saucepan ; or a new rubber ball on a nursery floor .
He had to !
He tucked up his front legs ; he hopped on his hind legs ; he stuck out his tail for a balance-weight behind him ; and he hopped through the Darling Downs .
He had to !
Still ran Dingo -- Tired-Dog Dingo -- hungrier and hungrier , very much bewildered , and wondering when in the world or out of it would Old Man Kangaroo stop .
Then came Nqong from his bath in the salt-pans , and said , ` It's five o'clock . '
Down sat Dingo -- Poor Dog Dingo -- always hungry , dusky in the sunshine ; hung out his tongue and howled .
Down sat Kangaroo -- Old Man Kangaroo -- stuck out his tail like a milking-stool behind him , and said , ` Thank goodness that's finished ! '
Then said Nqong , who is always a gentleman , ` Why aren't you grateful to Yellow-Dog Dingo ?
Why don't you thank him for all he has done for you ? '
Then said Kangaroo -- Tired Old Kangaroo -- He's chased me out of the homes of my childhood ; he's chased me out of my regular meal-times ; he's altered my shape so I'll never get it back ; and he's played Old Scratch with my legs . '
Then said Nqong , ` Perhaps I 'm mistaken , but didn't you ask me to make you different from all other animals , as well as to make you very truly sought after ?
And now it is five o'clock . '
` Yes , ' said Kangaroo . '
I wish that I hadn't .
I thought you would do it by charms and incantations , but this is a practical joke . '
` Joke ! '
said Nqong from his bath in the blue gums .
` Say that again and I'll whistle up Dingo and run your hind legs off . '
` No , ' said the Kangaroo . '
I must apologise .
Legs are legs , and you needn't alter 'em so far as I am concerned .
I only meant to explain to Your Lordliness that I've had nothing to eat since morning , and I 'm very empty indeed . '
` Yes , ' said Dingo -- Yellow-Dog Dingo , -- ' I am just in the same situation .
I've made him different from all other animals ; but what may I have for my tea ? '
Then said Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan , ` Come and ask me about it tomorrow , because I 'm going to wash . '
So they were left in the middle of Australia , Old Man Kangaroo and Yellow-Dog Dingo , and each said , ` That's your fault . '
THIS is the mouth-filling song Of the race that was run by a Boomer , Run in a single burst -- only event of its kind -- Started by big God Nqong from Warrigaborrigarooma , Old Man Kangaroo first : Yellow-Dog Dingo behind .
Kangaroo bounded away , His back-legs working like pistons -- Bounded from morning till dark , Twenty-five feet to a bound .
Yellow-Dog Dingo lay Like a yellow cloud in the distance -- Much too busy to bark .
My !
but they covered the ground !
Nobody knows where they went , Or followed the track that they flew in , For that Continent Hadn't been given a name .
They ran thirty degrees , From Torres Straits to the Leeuwin , Look at the Atlas , please , And they ran back as they came .
