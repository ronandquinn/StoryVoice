In a little village in the country of Japan there lived long , long ago a man and his wife .
For many years they were happy and prosperous , but bad times came , and at last nothing was left them but their daughter , who was as beautiful as the morning .
The neighbours were very kind , and would have done anything they could to help their poor friends , but the old couple felt that since everything had changed they would rather go elsewhere , so one day they set off to bury themselves in the country , taking their daughter with them .
Now the mother and daughter had plenty to do in keeping the house clean and looking after the garden , but the man would sit for hours together gazing straight in front of him , and thinking of the riches that once were his .
Each day he grew more and more wretched , till at length he took to his bed and never got up again .
His wife and daughter wept bitterly for his loss , and it was many months before they could take pleasure in anything .
Then one morning the mother suddenly looked at the girl , and found that she had grown still more lovely than before .
Once her heart would have been glad at the sight , but now that they two were alone in the world she feared some harm might come of it .
So , like a good mother , she tried to teach her daughter all she knew , and to bring her up to be always busy , so that she would never have time to think about herself .
And the girl was a good girl , and listened to all her mother's lessons , and so the years passed away .
At last one wet spring the mother caught cold , and though in the beginning she did not pay much attention to it , she gradually grew more and more ill , and knew that she had not long to live .
Then she called her daughter and told her that very soon she would be alone in the world ; that she must take care of herself , as there would be no one to take care of her .
And because it was more difficult for beautiful women to pass unheeded than for others , she bade her fetch a wooden helmet out of the next room , and put it on her head , and pull it low down over her brows , so that nearly the whole of her face should lie in its shadow .
The girl did as she was bid , and her beauty was so hidden beneath the wooden cap , which covered up all her hair , that she might have gone through any crowd , and no one would have looked twice at her .
And when she saw this the heart of the mother was at rest , and she lay back in her bed and died .
The girl wept for many days , but by-and-by she felt that , being alone in the world , she must go and get work , for she had only herself to depend upon .
There was none to be got by staying where she was , so she made her clothes into a bundle , and walked over the hills till she reached the house of the man who owned the fields in that part of the country .
And she took service with him and laboured for him early and late , and every night when she went to bed she was at peace , for she had not forgotten one thing that she had promised her mother ; and , however hot the sun might be , she always kept the wooden helmet on her head , and the people gave her the nickname of Hatschihime .
In spite , however , of all her care the fame of her beauty spread abroad : many of the impudent young men that are always to be found in the world stole softly up behind her while she was at work , and tried to lift off the wooden helmet .
But the girl would have nothing to say to them , and only bade them be off ; then they began to talk to her , but she never answered them , and went on with what she was doing , though her wages were low and food not very plentiful .
Still she could manage to live , and that was enough .
One day her master happened to pass through the field where she was working , and was struck by her industry and stopped to watch her .
After a while he put one or two questions to her , and then led her into his house , and told her that henceforward her only duty should be to tend his sick wife .
From this time the girl felt as if all her troubles were ended , but the worst of them was yet to come .
Not very long after Hatschihime had become maid to the sick woman , the eldest son of the house returned home from Kioto , where he had been studying all sorts of things .
He was tired of the splendours of the town and its pleasures , and was glad enough to be back in the green country , among the peach-blossoms and sweet flowers .
Strolling about in the early morning , he caught sight of the girl with the odd wooden helmet on her head , and immediately he went to his mother to ask who she was , and where she came from , and why she wore that strange thing over her face .
His mother answered that it was a whim , and nobody could persuade her to lay it aside ; whereat the young man laughed , but kept his thoughts to himself .
One hot day , however , he happened to be going towards home when he caught sight of his mother's waiting maid kneeling by a little stream that flowed through the garden , splashing some water over her face .
The helmet was pushed on one side , and as the youth stood watching from behind a tree he had a glimpse of the girl's great beauty ; and he determined that no one else should be his wife .
But when he told his family of his resolve to marry her they were very angry , and made up all sorts of wicked stories about her .
However , they might have spared themselves the trouble , as he knew it was only idle talk . '
I have merely to remain firm , ' thought he , ` and they will have to give in . '
It was such a good match for the girl that it never occurred to anyone that she would refuse the young man , but so it was .
It would not be right , she felt , to make a quarrel in the house , and though in secret she wept bitterly , for a long while , nothing would make her change her mind .
At length one night her mother appeared to her in a dream , and bade her marry the young man .
So the next time he asked her -- as he did nearly every day -- to his surprise and joy she consented .
The parents then saw they had better make the best of a bad business , and set about making the grand preparations suitable to the occasion .
Of course the neighbours said a great many ill-natured things about the wooden helmet , but the bridegroom was too happy to care , and only laughed at them .
When everything was ready for the feast , and the bride was dressed in the most beautiful embroidered dress to be found in Japan , the maids took hold of the helmet to lift it off her head , so that they might do her hair in the latest fashion .
But the helmet would not come , and the harder they pulled , the faster it seemed to be , till the poor girl yelled with pain .
Hearing her cries the bridegroom ran in and soothed her , and declared that she should be married in the helmet , as she could not be married without .
Then the ceremonies began , and the bridal pair sat together , and the cup of wine was brought them , out of which they had to drink .
And when they had drunk it all , and the cup was empty , a wonderful thing happened .
The helmet suddenly burst with a loud noise , and fell in pieces on the ground ; and as they all turned to look they found the floor covered with precious stones which had fallen out of it .
But the guests were less astonished at the brilliancy of the diamonds than at the beauty of the bride , which was beyond anything they had ever seen or heard of .
The night was passed in singing and dancing , and then the bride and bridegroom went to their own house , where they lived till they died , and had many children , who were famous throughout Japan for their goodness and beauty .
