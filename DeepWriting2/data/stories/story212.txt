Long , long ago an old couple lived in a village , and , as they had no children to love and care for , they gave all their affection to a little dog .
He was a pretty little creature , and instead of growing spoilt and disagreeable at not getting everything he wanted , as even children will do sometimes , the dog was grateful to them for their kindness , and never left their side , whether they were in the house or out of it .
One day the old man was working in his garden , with his dog , as usual , close by .
The morning was hot , and at last he put down his spade and wiped his wet forehead , noticing , as he did so , that the animal was snuffling and scratching at a spot a little way off .
There was nothing very strange in this , as all dogs are fond of scratching , and he went on quietly with his digging , when the dog ran up to his master , barking loudly , and back again to the place where he had been scratching .
This he did several times , till the old man wondered what could be the matter , and , picking up the spade , followed where the dog led him .
The dog was so delighted at his success that he jumped round , barking loudly , till the noise brought the old woman out of the house .
Curious to know if the dog had really found anything , the husband began to dig , and very soon the spade struck against something .
He stooped down and pulled out a large box , filled quite full with shining gold pieces .
The box was so heavy that the old woman had to help to carry it home , and you may guess what a supper the dog had that night !
Now that he had made them rich , they gave him every day all that a dog likes best to eat , and the cushions on which he lay were fit for a prince .
The story of the dog and his treasure soon became known , and a neighbour whose garden was next the old people's grew so envious of their good luck that he could neither eat nor sleep .
As the dog had discovered a treasure once , this foolish man thought he must be able to discover one always , and begged the old couple to lend him their pet for a little while , so that he might be made rich also .
` How can you ask such a thing ? '
answered the old man indignantly .
` You know how much we love him , and that he is never out of our sight for five minutes . '
But the envious neighbour would not heed his words , and came daily with the same request , till at last the old people , who could not bear to say no to anyone , promised to lend the dog , just for a night or two .
No sooner did the man get hold of the dog than he turned him into the garden , but the dog did nothing but race about , and the man was forced to wait with what patience he could .
The next morning the man opened the house door , and the dog bounded joyfully into the garden , and , running up to the foot of a tree , began to scratch wildly .
The man called loudly to his wife to bring a spade , and followed the dog , as he longed to catch the first glimpse of the expected treasure .
But when he had dug up the ground , what did he find ?
Why , nothing but a parcel of old bones , which smelt so badly that he could not stay there a moment longer .
And his heart was filled with rage against the dog who had played him this trick , and he seized a pickaxe and killed it on the spot , before he knew what he was doing .
When he remembered that he would have to go with his story to the old man and his wife he was rather frightened , but there was nothing to be gained by putting it off , so he pulled a very long face and went to his neighbour's garden .
` Your dog , ' said he , pretending to weep , ` has suddenly fallen down dead , though I took every care of him , and gave him everything he could wish for .
And I thought I had better come straight and tell you . '
Weeping bitterly , the old man went to fetch the body of his favourite , and brought it home and buried it under the fig-tree where he had found the treasure .
From morning till night he and his wife mourned over their loss , and nothing could comfort them .
At length , one night when he was asleep , he dreamt that the dog appeared to him and told him to cut down the fig-tree over his grave , and out of its wood to make a mortar .
But when the old man woke and thought of his dream he did not feel at all inclined to cut down the tree , which bore well every year , and consulted his wife about it .
The woman did not hesitate a moment , and said that after what had happened before , the dog's advice must certainly be obeyed , so the tree was felled , and a beautiful mortar made from it .
And when the season came for the rice crop to be gathered the mortar was taken down from its shelf , and the grains placed in it for pounding , when , lo and behold !
in a twinkling of an eye , they all turned into gold pieces .
At the sight of all this gold the hearts of the old people were glad , and once more they blessed their faithful dog .
But it was not long before this story also came to the ears of their envious neighbour , and he lost no time in going to the old people and asking if they happened to have a mortar which they could lend him .
The old man did not at all like parting with his precious treasure , but he never could say no , so the neighbour went off with the mortar under his arm .
The moment he got into his own house he took a great handful of rice , and began to shell off the husks , with the help of his wife .
But , instead of the gold pieces for which they looked , the rice turned into berries with such a horrible smell that they were obliged to run away , after smashing the mortar in a rage and setting fire to the bits .
The old people next door were naturally very much put out when they learned the fate of their mortar , and were not at all comforted by the explanations and excuses made by their neighbour .
But that night the dog again appeared in a dream to his master , and told him that he must go and collect the ashes of the burnt mortar and bring them home .
Then , when he heard that the Daimio , or great lord to whom this part of the country belonged , was expected at the capital , he was to carry the ashes to the high road , through which the procession would have to pass .
And as soon as it was in sight he was to climb up all the cherry-trees and sprinkle the ashes on them , and they would soon blossom as they had never blossomed before .
This time the old man did not wait to consult his wife as to whether he was to do what his dog had told him , but directly he got up he went to his neighbour's house and collected the ashes of the burnt mortar .
He put them carefully in a china vase , and carried it to the high road , Sitting down on a seat till the Daimio should pass .
The cherry-trees were bare , for it was the season when small pots of them were sold to rich people , who kept them in hot places , so that they might blossom early and decorate their rooms .
As to the trees in the open air , no one would ever think of looking for the tiniest bud for more than a month yet .
The old man had not been waiting very long before he saw a cloud of dust in the far distance , and knew that it must be the procession of the Daimio .
On they came , every man dressed in his finest clothes , and the crowd that was lining the road bowed their faces to the ground as they went by .
Only the old man did not bow himself , and the great lord saw this , and bade one of his courtiers , in anger , go and inquire why he had disobeyed the ancient customs .
But before the messenger could reach him the old man had climbed the nearest tree and scattered his ashes far and wide , and in an instant the white flowers had flashed into life , and the heart of the Daimio rejoiced , and he gave rich presents to the old man , whom he sent for to his castle .
We may be sure that in a very little while the envious neighbour had heard this also , and his bosom was filled with hate .
He hastened to the place where he had burned the mortar , collected a few of the ashes which the old man had left behind , and took them to the road , hoping that his luck might be as good as the old man's , or perhaps even better .
His heart beat with pleasure when he caught the first glimpses of the Daimio's train , and he held himself ready for the right moment .
As the Daimio drew near he flung a great handful of ashes over the trees , but no buds or flowers followed the action : instead , the ashes were all blown back into the eyes of the Daimio and his warriors , till they cried out from pain .
Then the prince ordered the evil-doer to be seized and bound and thrown into prison , where he was kept for many months .
By the time he was set free everybody in his native village had found out his wickedness , and they would not let him live there any longer ; and as he would not leave off his evil ways he soon went from bad to worse , and came to a miserable end .
