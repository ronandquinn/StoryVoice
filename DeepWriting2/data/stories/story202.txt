It was the custom in old times that as soon as a Japanese boy reached manhood he should leave his home and roam through the land in search of adventures .
Sometimes he would meet with a young man bent on the same business as himself , and then they would fight in a friendly manner , merely to prove which was the stronger , but on other occasions the enemy would turn out to be a robber , who had become the terror of the neighbourhood , and then the battle was in deadly earnest .
One day a youth started off from his native village , resolved never to come back till he had done some great deed that would make his name famous .
But adventures did not seem very plentiful just then , and he wandered about for a long time without meeting either with fierce giants or distressed damsels .
At last he saw in the distance a wild mountain , half covered with a dense forest , and thinking that this promised well at once took the road that led to it .
The difficulties he met with -- huge rocks to be climbed , deep rivers to be crossed , and thorny tracts to be avoided -- only served to make his heart beat quicker , for he was really brave all through , and not merely when he could not help himself , like a great many people .
But in spite of all his efforts he could not find his way out of the forest , and he began to think he should have to pass the night there .
Once more he strained his eyes to see if there was no place in which he could take shelter , and this time he caught sight of a small chapel in a little clearing .
He hastened quickly towards it , and curling himself up in a warm corner soon fell asleep .
Not a sound was heard through the whole forest for some hours , but at midnight there suddenly arose such a clamour that the young man , tired as he was , started broad awake in an instant .
Peeping cautiously between the wooden pillars of the chapel , he saw a troop of hideous cats , dancing furiously , making the night horrible with their yells .
The full moon lighted up the weird scene , and the young warrior gazed with astonishment , taking great care to keep still , lest he should be discovered .
After some time he thought that in the midst of all their shrieks he could make out the words , ` Do not tell Schippeitaro !
Keep it hidden and secret !
Do not tell Schippeitaro ! '
Then , the midnight hour having passed , they all vanished , and the youth was left alone .
Exhausted by all that had been going on round him , he flung himself on the ground and slept till the sun rose .
The moment he woke he felt very hungry , and began to think how he could get something to eat .
So he got up and walked on , and before he had gone very far was lucky enough to find a little side-path , where he could trace men's footsteps .
He followed the track , and by-and-by came on some scattered huts , beyond which lay a village .
Delighted at this discovery , he was about to hasten to the village when he heard a woman's voice weeping and lamenting , and calling on the men to take pity on her and help her .
The sound of her distress made him forget he was hungry , and he strode into the hut to find out for himself what was wrong .
But the men whom he asked only shook their heads and told him it was not a matter in which he could give any help , for all this sorrow was caused by the Spirit of the Mountain , to whom every year they were bound to furnish a maiden for him to eat .
` To-morrow night , ' said they , ` the horrible creature will come for his dinner , and the cries you have heard were uttered by the girl before you , upon whom the lot has fallen . '
And when the young man asked if the girl was carried off straight from her home , they answered no , but that a large cask was set in the forest chapel , and into this she was fastened .
As he listened to this story , the young man was filled with a great longing to rescue the maiden from her dreadful fate .
The mention of the chapel set him thinking of the scene of the previous night , and he went over all the details again in his mind .
` Who is Schippeitaro ? '
he suddenly asked ; ` can any of you tell me ? '
` Schippeitaro is the great dog that belongs to the overseer of our prince , ' said they ; ` and he lives not far away . '
And they began to laugh at the question , which seemed to them so odd and useless .
The young man did not laugh with them , but instead left the hut and went straight to the owner of the dog , whom he begged to lend him the animal just for one night .
Schippeitaro's master was not at all willing to give him in charge to a man of whom he knew nothing , but in the end he consented , and the youth led the dog away , promising faithfully to return him next day to his master .
He next hurried to the hut where the maiden lived , and entreated her parents to shut her up safely in a closet , after which he took Schippeitaro to the cask , and fastened him into it .
In the evening he knew that the cask would be placed in the chapel , so he hid himself there and waited .
At midnight , when the full moon appeared above the top of the mountain , the cats again filled the chapel and shrieked and yelled and danced as before .
But this time they had in their midst a huge black cat who seemed to be their king , and whom the young man guessed to be the Spirit of the Mountain .
The monster looked eagerly about him , and his eyes sparkled with joy when he saw the cask .
He bounded high into the air with delight and uttered cries of pleasure ; then he drew near and undid the bolts .
But instead of fastening his teeth in the neck of a beautiful maiden , Schippeitaro's teeth were fastened in HIM , and the youth ran up and cut off his head with his sword .
The other cats were so astonished at the turn things had taken that they forgot to run away , and the young man and Schippeitaro between them killed several more before they thought of escaping .
At sunrise the brave dog was taken back to his master , and from that time the mountain girls were safe , and every year a feast was held in memory of the young warrior and the dog Schippeitaro .
