Fir Cottage , Plover Sands .
July Sixth .
We arrived here late last night , and all day Aunt Martha has kept her room to rest .
So I had to keep mine also , although I felt as fresh as a morning lark , and just in the mood for enjoyment .
My name is Marguerite Forrester -- an absurdly long name for so small a girl .
Aunt Martha always calls me Marguer_ite , with an accent of strong disapproval .
She does not like my name , but she gives me the full benefit of it .
Connie Shelmardine used to call me Rita .
Connie was my roommate last year at the Seminary .
We correspond occasionally , but Aunt Martha frowns on it .
I have always lived with Aunt Martha -- my parents died when I was a baby .
Aunt Martha says I am to be her heiress if I please her -- which means -- but , oh , you do not know what `` pleasing '' Aunt Martha means .
Aunt is a determined and inveterate man-hater .
She has no particular love for women , indeed , and trusts nobody but Mrs. Saxby , her maid .
I rather like Mrs. Saxby .
She is not quite so far gone in petrifaction as Aunt , although she gets a little stonier every year .
I expect the process will soon begin on me , but it hasn't yet .
My flesh and blood are still unreasonably warm and pulsing and rebellious .
Aunt Martha would be in danger of taking a fit if she ever saw me talking to a man .
She watches me jealously , firmly determined to guard me from any possible attack of a roaring and ravening lion in the disguise of nineteenth-century masculine attire .
So I have to walk demurely and assume a virtue , if I have it not , while I pine after the untested flesh-pots of Egypt in secret .
We have come down to spend a few weeks at Fir Cottage .
Our good landlady is a capacious , kindly-souled creature , and I think she has rather a liking for me .
I have been chattering to her all day , for there are times when I absolutely must talk to someone or go mad .
July Tenth .
This sort of life is decidedly dull .
The program of every day is the same .
I go to the sandshore with Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby in the morning , read to Aunt in the afternoons , and mope around by my disconsolate self in the evenings .
Mrs. Blake has lent me , for shore use , a very fine spyglass which she owns .
She says her `` man '' brought it home from `` furrin ' parts '' before he died .
While Aunt and Mrs. Saxby meander up and down the shore , leaving me free to a certain extent , I amuse myself by examining distant seas and coasts through it , thus getting a few peeps into a forbidden world .
We see few people , although there is a large summer hotel about a mile up the beach .
Our shore haunts do not seem to be popular with its guests .
They prefer the rocks .
This suits Aunt Martha admirably .
I may also add that it doesn't suit her niece -- but that is a matter of small importance .
The first morning I noticed a white object on the rocks , about half a mile away , and turned my glass on it .
There -- apparently within a stone 's throw of me -- was a young man .
He was lounging on a rock , looking dreamily out to sea .
There was something about his face that reminded me of someone I know , but I can not remember whom .
Every morning he has reappeared on the same spot .
He seems to be a solitary individual , given to prowling by himself .
I wonder what Aunt would say if she knew what I am so earnestly watching through my glass at times .
July Eleventh .
I shall have to cease looking at the Unknown , I am afraid .
This morning I turned my glass , as usual , on his pet haunt .
I nearly fell over in my astonishment , for he was also looking through a spyglass straight at me , too , it seemed .
How foolish I felt !
And yet my curiosity was so strong that a few minutes afterward I peeped back again , just to see what he was doing .
Then he coolly laid down his glass , rose , lifted his cap and bowed politely to me -- or , at least , in my direction .
I dropped my glass and smiled in a mixture of dismay and amusement .
Then I remembered that he was probably watching me again , and might imagine my smile was meant for him .
I banished it immediately , shut my glass up and did not touch it again .
Soon after we came home .
July Twelfth .
Something has happened at last .
Today I went to the shore as usual , fully resolved not even to glance in the forbidden direction .
But in the end I had to take a peep , and saw him on the rocks with his glass levelled at me .
When he saw that I was looking he laid down the glass , held up his hands , and began to spell out something in the deaf-mute alphabet .
Now , I know that same alphabet .
Connie taught it to me last year , so that we might hold communication across the schoolroom .
I gave one frantic glance at Aunt Martha 's rigid back , and then watched him while he deftly spelled : `` I am Francis Shelmardine .
Are you not Miss Forrester , my sister 's friend ? ''
Francis Shelmardine !
Now I knew whom he resembled .
And have I not heard endless dissertations from Connie on this wonderful brother of hers , Francis the clever , the handsome , the charming , until he has become the only hero of dreams I have ever had ?
It was too wonderful .
I could only stare dazedly back through my glass .
`` May we know each other ? ''
he went on .
`` May I come over and introduce myself ?
Right hand , yes ; left , no . ''
I gasped !
Suppose he were to come ?
What would happen ?
I waved my left hand sorrowfully .
He looked quite crestfallen and disappointed as he spelled out : `` Why not ?
Would your friends disapprove ? ''
I signalled : `` Yes . ''
`` Are you displeased at my boldness ? ''
was his next question .
Where had all Aunt Martha 's precepts flown to then ?
I blush to record that I lifted my left hand shyly and had just time to catch his pleased expression when Aunt Martha came up and said it was time to go home .
So I picked myself meekly up , shook the sand from my dress , and followed my good aunt dutifully home .
July Thirteenth .
When we went to the shore this morning I had to wait in spasms of remorse and anxiety until Aunt got tired of reading and set off along the shore with Mrs. Saxby .
Then I reached for my glass .
Mr. Shelmardine and I had quite a conversation .
Under the circumstances there could be no useless circumlocution in our exchange of ideas .
It was religiously `` boiled down , '' and ran something like this : `` You are not displeased with me ? ''
`` No -- but I should be . ''
`` Why ? ''
`` It is wrong to deceive Aunt . ''
`` I am quite respectable . ''
`` That is not the question . ''
`` Can not her prejudices be overcome ? ''
`` Absolutely no . ''
`` Mrs. Allardyce , who is staying at the hotel , knows her well .
Shall I bring her over to vouch for my character ? ''
`` It would not do a bit of good . ''
`` Then it is hopeless . ''
`` Yes . ''
`` Would you object to knowing me on your own account ? ''
`` No . ''
`` Do you ever come to the shore alone ? ''
`` No .
Aunt would not permit me . ''
`` Must she know ? ''
`` Yes .
I would not come without her permission . ''
`` You will not refuse to chat with me thus now and then ? ''
`` I don't know .
Perhaps not . ''
I had to go home then .
As we went Mrs. Saxby complimented me on my good colour .
Aunt Martha looked her disapproval .
If I were really ill Aunt would spend her last cent in my behalf , but she would be just as well pleased to see me properly pale and subdued at all times , and not looking as if I were too well contented in this vale of tears .
July Seventeenth .
I have `` talked '' a good deal with Mr. Shelmardine these past four days .
He is to be at the beach for some weeks longer .
This morning he signalled across from the rocks : `` I mean to see you at last .
Tomorrow I will walk over and pass you . ''
`` You must not .
Aunt will suspect . ''
`` No danger .
don't be alarmed .
I will do nothing rash . ''
I suppose he will .
He seems to be very determined .
Of course , I can not prevent him from promenading on our beach all day if he chooses .
But then if he did , Aunt would speedily leave him in sole possession of it .
I wonder what I had better wear tomorrow .
July Nineteenth .
Yesterday morning Aunt Martha was serene and unsuspicious .
It is dreadful of me to be deceiving her and I do feel guilty .
I sat down on the sand and pretended to read the `` Memoirs of a Missionary '' -- Aunt likes cheerful books like that -- in an agony of anticipation .
Presently Aunt said , majestically : `` Marguer_ite , there is a man coming this way .
We will move further down . ''
And we moved .
Poor Aunt !
Mr. Shelmardine came bravely on .
I felt my heart beating to my very finger tips .
He halted by the fragment of an old stranded boat .
Aunt had turned her back on him .
I ventured on a look .
He lifted his hat with a twinkle in his eye .
Just then Aunt said , icily : `` We will go home , Marguer_ite .
That creature evidently intends to persist in his intrusion . ''
Home we came accordingly .
This morning he signalled across : `` Letter from Connie .
Message for you .
I mean to deliver it personally .
Do you ever go to church ? ''
Now , I do go regularly to church at home .
But Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby are both such rigid church people that they would not darken the doors of the Methodist church at Plover Sands for any consideration .
Needless to say , I am not allowed to go either .
But it was impossible to make this long explanation , so I merely replied : `` Not here . ''
`` Will you not go tomorrow morning ? ''
`` Aunt will not let me . ''
`` Coax her . ''
`` Coaxing never has any effect on her . ''
`` Would she relent if Mrs. Allardyce were to call for you ? ''
Now , I have been cautiously sounding Aunt about Mrs. Allardyce , and I have discovered that she disapproves of her .
So I said : `` It would be useless .
I will ask Aunt if I may go , but I feel almost sure that she will not consent . ''
This evening , when Aunt was in an unusually genial mood , I plucked up heart of grace and asked her .
`` Marguer_ite , '' she said impressively , `` you know that I do not attend church here . ''
`` But , Aunt , '' I persisted , quakingly , `` couldn't I go alone ?
It is not very far -- and I will be very careful . ''
Aunt merely gave me a look that said about forty distinct and separate things , and I was turning away in despair when Mrs. Saxby -- bless her heart -- said : `` I really think it would be no harm to let the child go . ''
As Aunt attaches great importance to Mrs. Saxby 's opinion , she looked at me relentingly and said : `` Well , I will think it over and let you know in the morning , Marguer_ite . ''
Now , everything depends on the sort of humour Aunt is in in the morning .
July Twentieth .
This morning was perfect , and after breakfast Aunt said , condescendingly : `` I think you may attend church if you wish , Marguer_ite .
Remember that I expect you to conduct yourself with becoming prudence and modesty . ''
I flew upstairs and pulled my prettiest dress out of my trunk .
It is a delicate , shimmering grey stuff with pearly tints about it .
Every time I get anything new , Aunt Martha and I have a battle royal over it .
I verily believe that Aunt would like me to dress in the fashions in vogue in her youth .
There is always a certain flavour of old-fashionedness about my gowns and hats .
Connie used to say that it was delicious and gave me a piquant uniqueness -- a certain unlikeness to other people that possessed a positive charm .
That is only Connie 's view of it , however .
But I had had my own way about this dress and it is really very becoming .
I wore a little silvery-grey chip hat , trimmed with pale pink flowers , and I pinned at my belt the sweetest cluster of old-fashioned blush rosebuds from the garden .
Then I borrowed a hymn book from Mrs. Blake and ran down to undergo Aunt Martha 's scrutiny .
`` Dear me , child , '' she said discontentedly , `` you have gotten yourself up very frivolously , it seems to me . ''
`` Why , Aunty , '' I protested , `` I 'm all in grey -- every bit . ''
Aunt Martha sniffed .
You don't know how much Aunt can express in a sniff .
But I tripped to church like a bird .
The first person I saw there was Mr. Shelmardine .
He was sitting right across from me and a smile glimmered in his eyes .
I did not look at him again .
Through the service I was subdued enough to have satisfied even Aunt Martha .
When church came out , he waited for me at the entrance to his pew .
I pretended not to see him until he said `` Good morning , '' in a voice vibrating and deep , which sounded as though it might become infinitely tender if its owner chose .
When we went down the steps he took my hymnal , and we walked up the long , bowery country road .
`` Thank you so much for coming today , '' he said -- as if I went to oblige him .
`` I had a hard time to get Aunt Martha 's consent , '' I declared frankly .
`` I wouldn't have succeeded if Mrs. Saxby hadn't taken my part . ''
`` Heaven bless Mrs. Saxby , '' he remarked fervently .
`` But is there any known way of overcoming your aunt 's scruples ?
If so , I am ready to risk it . ''
`` There is none .
Aunt Martha is very good and kind to me , but she will never stop trying to bring me up .
The process will be going on when I am fifty .
And she hates men !
I don't know what she would do if she saw me now . ''
Mr. Shelmardine frowned and switched the unoffending daisies viciously with his cane .
`` Then there is no hope of my seeing you openly and above-board ? ''
`` Not at present , '' I said faintly .
After a brief silence we began to talk of other things .
He told me how he happened to see me first .
`` I was curious to know who the people were who were always in the same place at the same time , so one day I took my telescope .
I could see you plainly .
You were reading and had your hat off .
When I went back to the hotel I asked Mrs. Allardyce if she knew who the boarders at Fir Cottage were and she told me .
I had heard Connie speak of you , and I determined to make your acquaintance . ''
When we reached the lane I held out my hand for the hymnal .
`` You mustn't come any further , Mr. Shelmardine , '' I said hurriedly .
`` Aunt -- Aunt might see you . ''
He took my hand and held it , looking at me seriously .
`` Suppose I were to walk up to the cottage tomorrow and ask for you ? ''
I gasped .
He looked so capable of doing anything he took it into his head to do .
`` Oh , you wouldn't , '' I said piteously .
`` Aunt Martha would -- you are not in earnest . ''
`` I suppose not , '' he said regretfully .
`` Of course I would not do anything that would cause you unpleasantness .
But this must not -- shall not be our last meeting . ''
`` Aunt will not let me come to church again , '' I said .
`` Does she ever take a nap in the afternoon ? ''
he queried .
I wriggled my parasol about in the dust uneasily .
`` Sometimes . ''
`` I shall be at the old boat tomorrow afternoon at two-thirty , '' he said .
I pulled my hand away .
`` I couldn't -- you know I couldn't , '' I cried -- and then I blushed to my ears .
`` Are you sure you couldn't ? ''
bending a little nearer .
`` Quite sure , '' I murmured .
He surrendered my hymnal at last .
`` Will you give me a rose ? ''
I unpinned the whole cluster and handed it to him .
He lifted it until it touched his lips .
As for me , I scuttled up the lane in the most undignified fashion .
At the turn I looked back .
He was still standing there with his hat off .
July Twenty-fourth .
On Monday afternoon I slipped away to the shore while Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby were taking their regular nap and I was supposed to be reading sermons in my room .
Mr. Shelmardine was leaning against the old boat , but he came swiftly across the sand to meet me .
`` This is very kind of you , '' he said .
`` I ought not to have come , '' I said repentantly .
`` But it is so lonely there -- and one can't be interested in sermons and memoirs all the time . ''
Mr. Shelmardine laughed .
`` Mr. and Mrs. Allardyce are on the other side of the boat .
Will you come and meet them ? ''
How nice of him to bring them !
I knew I should like Mrs. Allardyce , just because Aunt Martha didn't .
We had a delightful stroll .
I never thought of the time until Mr. Shelmardine said it was four o'clock .
`` Oh , is it so late as that ? ''
I cried .
`` I must go at once . ''
`` I 'm sorry we have kept you so long , '' remarked Mr. Shelmardine in a tone of concern .
`` If she should be awake , what will the consequences be ? ''
`` Too terrible to think of , '' I answered seriously .
`` I 'm sorry , Mr. Shelmardine , but you mustn't come any further . '' ''
We will be here tomorrow afternoon , '' he said .
`` Mr. Shelmardine ! ''
I protested .
`` I wish you wouldn't put such ideas into my head .
They won't come out -- no , not if I read a whole volume of sermons right through . ''
We looked at each other for a second .
Then he began to smile , and we both went off into a peal of laughter .
`` At least let me know if Miss Fiske rampages , '' he called after me as I fled .
But Aunt Martha was not awake -- and I have been to the shore three afternoons since then .
I was there today , and I 'm going tomorrow for a boat sail with Mr. Shelmardine and the Allardyces .
But I am afraid the former will do something rash soon .
This afternoon he said : `` I don't think I can stand this much longer . ''
`` Stand what ? ''
I asked .
`` You know very well , '' he answered recklessly .
`` Meeting you in this clandestine manner , and thereby causing that poor little conscience of yours such misery .
If your aunt were not so -- unreasonable , I should never have stooped to it . ''
`` It is all my fault , '' I said contritely .
`` Well , I hardly meant that , '' he said grimly .
`` But hadn't I better go frankly to your aunt and lay the whole case before her ? ''
`` You would never see me again if you did that , '' I said hastily -- and then wished I hadn't .
`` That is the worst threat you could make , '' he said .
July Twenty-fifth .
It is all over , and I am the most miserable girl in the world .
Of course this means that Aunt Martha has discovered everything and the deserved punishment of my sins has overtaken me .
I slipped away again this afternoon and went for that boat sail .
We had a lovely time but were rather late getting in , and I hurried home with many misgivings .
Aunt Martha met me at the door .
My dress was draggled , my hat had slipped back , and the kinks and curls of my obstreperous hair were something awful .
I know I looked very disreputable and also , no doubt , very guilty and conscience-stricken .
Aunt gave me an unutterable look and then followed me up to my room in grim silence .
`` Marguer_ite , what does this mean ? ''
I have lots of faults , but untruthfulness isn't one of them .
I confessed everything -- at least , almost everything .
I didn't tell about the telescopes and deaf-mute alphabet , and Aunt was too horror-stricken to think of asking how I first made Mr. Shelmardine 's acquaintance .
She listened in stony silence .
I had expected a terrible scolding , but I suppose my crimes simply seemed to her too enormous for words .
When I had sobbed out my last word she rose , swept me one glance of withering contempt , and left the room .
Presently Mrs. Saxby came up , looking concerned .
`` My dear child , what have you been doing ?
Your aunt says that we are to go home on the afternoon train tomorrow .
She is terribly upset . ''
I just curled up on the bed and cried , while Mrs. Saxby packed my trunk .
I will have no chance to explain matters to Mr. Shelmardine .
And I will never see him again , for Aunt is quite capable of whisking me off to Africa .
He will just think me a feather-brained flirt .
Oh , I am so unhappy !
July Twenty-sixth .
I am the happiest girl in the world !
That is quite a different strain from yesterday .
We leave Fir Cottage in an hour , but that doesn't matter now .
I did not sleep a wink last night and crawled miserably down to breakfast .
Aunt took not the slightest notice of me , but to my surprise she told Mrs. Saxby that she intended taking a farewell walk to the shore .
I knew I would be taken , too , to be kept out of mischief , and my heart gave a great bound of hope .
Perhaps I would have a chance to send word to Francis , since Aunt did not know of the part my spyglass had played in my bad behaviour .
I meekly followed my grim guardians to the shore and sat dejectedly on my rug while they paced the sand .
Francis was on the rocks .
As soon as Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby were at a safe distance , I began my message : `` All discovered .
Aunt is very angry .
We go home today . ''
Then I snatched my glass .
His face expressed the direst consternation and dismay .
He signalled : `` I must see you before you go . ''
`` Impossible .
Aunt will never forgive me .
Good-bye . ''
I saw a look of desperate determination cross his face .
If forty Aunt Marthas had swooped down upon me , I could not have torn my eyes from that glass .
`` I love you .
You know it .
Do you care for me ?
I must have my answer now . ''
What a situation !
No time or chance for any maidenly hesitation or softening aureole of words .
Aunt and Mrs. Saxby had almost reached the point where they invariably turned .
I had barely time to spell out a plain , blunt `` yes '' and read his answer .
`` I shall go home at once , get Mother and Connie , follow you , and demand possession of my property .
I shall win the day .
Have no fear .
Till then , good-bye , my darling . ''
`` Marguerite , '' said Mrs. Saxby at my elbow , `` it is time to go . ''
I got up obediently .
Aunt Martha was as grim and uncompromising as ever , and Mrs. Saxby looked like a chief mourner , but do you suppose I cared ?
I dropped behind them just once before we left the shore .
I knew he was watching me and I waved my hand .
I suppose I am really engaged to Francis Shelmardine .
But was there ever such a funny wooing ?
And what will Aunt Martha say ?
