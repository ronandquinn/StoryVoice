The moonlight fades from flower and tree , And the stars dim one by one ; The tale is told , the song is sung , And the Fairy feast is done .
The night-wind rocks the sleeping flowers , And sings to them , soft and low .
The early birds erelong will wake : ' T is time for the Elves to go .
O'er the sleeping earth we silently pass , Unseen by mortal eye , And send sweet dreams , as we lightly float Through the quiet moonlit sky ; -- For the stars ' soft eyes alone may see , And the flowers alone may know , The feasts we hold , the tales we tell : So ' t is time for the Elves to go .
From bird , and blossom , and bee , We learn the lessons they teach ; And seek , by kindly deeds , to win A loving friend in each .
And though unseen on earth we dwell , Sweet voices whisper low , And gentle hearts most joyously greet The Elves where'er they go .
When next we meet in the Fairy dell , May the silver moon's soft light Shine then on faces gay as now , And Elfin hearts as light .
Now spread each wing , for the eastern sky With sunlight soon will glow .
The morning star shall light us home : Farewell !
for the Elves must go .
