Once upon a time there lived in Japan a rat and his wife who came of an old and noble race , and had one daughter , the loveliest girl in all the rat world .
Her parents were very proud of her , and spared no pains to teach her all she ought to know .
There was not another young lady in the whole town who was as clever as she was in gnawing through the hardest wood , or who could drop from such a height on to a bed , or run away so fast if anyone was heard coming .
Great attention , too , was paid to her personal appearance , and her skin shone like satin , while her teeth were as white as pearls , and beautifully pointed .
Of course , with all these advantages , her parents expected her to make a brilliant marriage , and , as she grew up , they began to look round for a suitable husband .
But here a difficulty arose .
The father was a rat from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail , outside as well as in , and desired that his daughter should wed among her own people .
She had no lack of lovers , but her father's secret hopes rested on a fine young rat , with moustaches which almost swept the ground , whose family was still nobler and more ancient than his own .
Unluckily , the mother had other views for her precious child .
She was one of those people who always despise their own family and surroundings , and take pleasure in thinking that they themselves are made of finer material than the rest of the world .
` HER daughter should never marry a mere rat , ' she declared , holding her head high .
` With her beauty and talents she had a right to look for someone a little better than THAT . '
So she talked , as mothers will , to anyone that would listen to her .
What the girl thought about the matter nobody knew or cared -- it was not the fashion in the rat world .
Many were the quarrels which the old rat and his wife had upon the subject , and sometimes they bore on their faces certain marks which looked as if they had not kept to words only .
` Reach up to the stars is MY motto , ' cried the lady one day , when she was in a greater passion than usual .
` My daughter's beauty places her higher than anything upon earth , ' she cried ; ` and I am certainly not going to accept a son-in-law who is beneath her . '
` Better offer her in marriage to the sun , ' answered her husband impatiently .
` As far as I know there is nothing greater than he . '
` Well , I WAS thinking of it , ' replied the wife , ` and as you are of the same mind , we will pay him a visit to-morrow . '
So the next morning , the two rats , having spent hours in making themselves smart , set out to see the sun , leading their daughter between them .
The journey took some time , but at length they came to the golden palace where the sun lived .
` Noble king , ' began the mother , ` behold our daughter !
She is so beautiful that she is above everything in the whole world .
Naturally , we wish for a son-in-law who , on his side , is greater than all .
Therefore we have come to you . ' '
I feel very much flattered , ' replied the sun , who was so busy that he had not the least wish to marry anybody .
` You do me great honour by your proposal .
Only , in one point you are mistaken , and it would be wrong of me to take advantage of your ignorance .
There is something greater than I am , and that is the cloud .
Look ! '
And as he spoke a cloud spread itself over the sun's face , blotting out his rays .
` Oh , well , we will speak to the cloud , ' said the mother .
And turning to the cloud she repeated her proposal .
` Indeed I am unworthy of anything so charming , ' answered the cloud ; ` but you make a mistake again in what you say .
There is one thing that is even more powerful than I , and that is the wind .
Ah , here he comes , you can see for yourself . '
And she DID see , for catching up the cloud as he passed , he threw it on the other side of the sky .
Then , tumbling father , mother and daughter down to the earth again , he paused for a moment beside them , his foot on an old wall .
When she had recovered her breath , the mother began her little speech once more .
` The wall is the proper husband for your daughter , ' answered the wind , whose home consisted of a cave , which he only visited when he was not rushing about elsewhere ; ` you can see for yourself that he is greater than I , for he has power to stop me in my flight . '
And the mother , who did not trouble to conceal her wishes , turned at once to the wall .
Then something happened which was quite unexpected by everyone . '
I won't marry that ugly old wall , which is as old as my grandfather , ' sobbed the girl , who had not uttered one word all this time . '
I would have married the sun , or the cloud , or the wind , because it was my duty , although I love the handsome young rat , and him only .
But that horrid old wall -- I would sooner die ! '
And the wall , rather hurt in his feelings , declared that he had no claim to be the husband of so beautiful a girl .
` It is quite true , ' he said , ` that I can stop the wind who can part the clouds who can cover the sun ; but there is someone who can do more than all these , and that is the rat .
It is the rat who passes through me , and can reduce me to powder , simply with his teeth .
If , therefore , you want a son-in-law who is greater than the whole world , seek him among the rats . '
` Ah , what did I tell you ? '
cried the father .
And his wife , though for the moment angry at being beaten , soon thought that a rat son-in-law was what she had always desired .
So all three returned happily home , and the wedding was celebrated three days after .
