ONCE upon a time there reigned in Pantouflia a king and a queen .
With almost everything else to make them happy , they wanted one thing : they had no children .
This vexed the king even more than the queen , who was very clever and learned , and who had hated dolls when she was a child .
However , she too , in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures she painted , would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince .
The king was anxious to consult the fairies , but the queen would not hear of such a thing .
She did not believe in fairies : she said that they had never existed ; and that she maintained , though The History of the Royal Family was full of chapters about nothing else .
Well , at long and at last they had a little boy , who was generally regarded as the finest baby that had ever been seen .
Even her majesty herself remarked that , though she could never believe all the courtiers told her , yet he certainly was a fine child -- a very fine child .
Now , the time drew near for the christening party , and the king and queen were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it .
It was a splendid room , hung with portraits of the royal ancestors .
There was Cinderella , the grandmother of the reigning monarch , with her little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her .
There was the Marquis de Carabas , who , as everyone knows , was raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period .
On the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat , wearing boots .
There , too , was a portrait of a beautiful lady , sound asleep : this was Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant , also an ancestress of the royal family .
Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls .
`` You have asked all the right people , my dear ? ''
said the king .
`` Everyone who should be asked , '' answered the queen .
`` People are so touchy on these occasions , '' said his majesty .
`` You have not forgotten any of our aunts ? ''
`` No ; the old cats ! ''
replied the queen ; for the king's aunts were old-fashioned , and did not approve of her , and she knew it .
`` They are very kind old ladies in their way , '' said the king ; `` and were nice to me when I was a boy . ''
Then he waited a little , and remarked : `` The fairies , of course , you have invited ?
It has always been usual , in our family , on an occasion like this ; and I think we have neglected them a little of late . ''
`` How can you be so absurd ?
'' cried the queen .
`` How often must I tell you that there are no fairies ?
And even if there were -- but , no matter ; pray let us drop the subject . ''
`` They are very old friends of our family , my dear , that's all , '' said the king timidly .
`` Often and often they have been godmothers to us .
One , in particular , was most kind and most serviceable to Cinderella I. , my own grandmother . ''
`` Your grandmother ! ''
interrupted her majesty .
`` Fiddle-de-dee !
If anyone puts such nonsense into the head of my little Prigio -- '' But here the baby was brought in by the nurse , and the queen almost devoured it with kisses .
And so the fairies were not invited !
It was an extraordinary thing , but none of the nobles could come to the christening party when they learned that the fairies had not been asked .
Some were abroad ; several were ill ; a few were in prison among the Saracens ; others were captives in the dens of ogres .
The end of it was that the king and queen had to sit down alone , one at each end of a very long table , arrayed with plates and glasses for a hundred guests -- for a hundred guests who never came !
`` Any soup , my dear ? ''
shouted the king , through a speaking-trumpet ; when , suddenly , the air was filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings of birds .
Flitter , flitter , flutter , went the noise ; and when the queen looked up , lo and behold !
on every seat was a lovely fairy , dressed in green , each with a most interesting-looking parcel in her hand .
Don't you like opening parcels ?
The king did , and he was most friendly and polite to the fairies .
But the queen , though she saw them distinctly , took no notice of them .
You see , she did not believe in fairies , nor in her own eyes , when she saw them .
So she talked across the fairies to the king , just as if they had not been there ; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which , of course , they were .
When dinner was over , and when the nurse had brought in the baby , all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents .
One offered a purse which could never be empty ; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots ; and another a cap of darkness , that nobody might see the prince when he put it on ; and another a wishing-cap ; and another a carpet , on which , when he sat , he was carried wherever he wished to find himself .
Another made him beautiful for ever ; and another , brave ; and another , lucky : but the last fairy of all , a cross old thing , crept up and said , `` My child , you shall be too clever ! ''
This fairy's gift would have pleased the queen , if she had believed in it , more than anything else , because she was so clever herself .
But she took no notice at all ; and the fairies went each to her own country , and none of them stayed there at the palace , where nobody believed in them , except the king , a little .
But the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps , carpets , purses , swords , and all , away into a dark lumber-room ; for , of course , she thought that they were all nonsense , and merely old rubbish out of books , or pantomime `` properties . ''
-- Prince Prigio and his family WELL , the little prince grew up .
I think I've told you that his name was Prigio -- did I not ?
Well , that was his name .
You can not think how clever he was .
He argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak , which was very soon .
He argued that he did not like to be washed , because the soap got into his eyes .
However , when he was told all about the pores of the skin , and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed , he at once ceased to resist , for he was very reasonable .
He argued with his father that he did not see why there should be kings who were rich , while beggars were poor ; and why the king -- who was a little greedy -- should have poached eggs and plum-cake at afternoon tea , while many other persons went without dinner .
The king was so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the prince's ears , saying , `` I'll teach you to be too clever , my lad . ''
Then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy , and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen .
And when the prince , after having his ears boxed , said that `` force was no argument , '' the king went away in a rage .
Indeed , I can not tell you how the prince was hated by all !
He would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup .
He would visit the poor people's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon .
He showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers .
He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does .
The young ladies of the court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? ''
and `` Have you read that ? ''
-- and when they said they hadn't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out .
He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife .
He also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !
In fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he never was in the wrong , and he always said , `` Didn't I tell you so ? ''
And , what was more , he had !
As time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked : They were not a bit clever , but jolly .
Prince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion .
Prince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a `` little sad , but never too clever . ''
Both were in love with two of their own cousins , with the approval of their dear parents ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''
But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .
Now , as Pantouflia was a rich , lazy country , which hated fighting , this was very unpleasant , and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better .
OF all the people who did not like Prigio , his own dear papa , King Grognio , disliked him most .
For the king knew he was not clever himself .
When he was in the counting-house , counting out his money , and when he happened to say , `` Sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three pounds , fifteen , '' it made him wild to hear Prigio whisper , `` One pound , ten and twopence , '' -- which , of course , it is .
And the king was afraid that Prigio would conspire , and get made king himself -- which was the last thing Prigio really wanted .
He much preferred to idle about , and know everything without seeming to take any trouble .
Well , the king thought and thought .
How was he to get Prigio out of the way , and make Enrico or Alphonso his successor ?
He read in books about it ; and all the books showed that , if a king sent his three sons to do anything , it was always the youngest who did it , and got the crown .
And he wished he had the chance .
Well , it arrived at last .
There was a very hot summer !
It began to be hot in March . '
All the rivers were dried up .
The grass did not grow .
The corn did not grow .
The thermometers exploded with heat .
The barometers stood at Set Fair .
The people were much distressed , and came and broke the palace win-dows -- as they usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia .
The king consulted the learned men about the Court , who told him that probably a FIREDRAKE was in the neighbourhood .
Now , the Firedrake is a beast , or bird , about the bigness of an elephant .
Its body is made of iron , and it is always red-hot .
A more terrible and cruel beast can not be imagined ; for , if you go near it , you are at once broiled by the Firedrake .
But the king was not ill-pleased : `` for , '' thought he , `` of course my three sons must go after the brute , the eldest first ; and , as usual , it will kill the first two , and be beaten by the youngest .
It is a little hard on Enrico , poor boy ; but anything to get rid of that Prigio ! ''
Then the king went to Prigio , and said that his country was in danger , and that he was determined to leave the crown to whichever of them would bring him the horns , for it has horns , and tail of the Firedrake .
`` It is an awkward brute to tackle , '' the king said , `` but you are the oldest , my lad ; go where glory waits you !
Put on your armour , and be off with you ! ''
This the king said , hoping that either the Firedrake would roast Prince Prigio alive , which he could easily do , as I have said ; for he is all over as hot as a red-hot poker , or that , if the prince succeeded , at least his country would be freed from the monster .
But the prince , who was lying on the sofa doing sums in compound division , for fun , said in the politest way : `` Thanks to the education your majesty has given me , I have learned that the Firedrake , like the siren , the fairy , and so forth , is a fabulous animal which does not exist .
But even granting , for the sake of argument , that there is a Firedrake , your majesty is well aware that there is no kind of use in sending me .
It is always the eldest son who goes out first , and comes to grief on these occasions , and it is always the third son that succeeds .
Send Alphonso '' , this was the youngest brother , `` and he will do the trick at once .
At least , if he fails , it will be most unusual , and Enrico can try his luck . ''
Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate , and the king had to send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico .
They both came in very warm ; for they had been whipping tops , and the day was unusually hot .
`` Look here , '' said the king , `` just you two younger ones look at Prigio !
You see how hot it is , and how coolly he takes it , and the country suffering ; and all on account of a Firedrake , you know , which has apparently built his nest not far off .
Well , I have asked that lout of a brother of yours to kill it , and he says -- '' `` That he does not believe in Firedrakes , '' interrupted Prigio , `` The weather's warm enough without going out hunting ! ''
`` Not believe in Firedrakes ! ''
cried Alphonso .
`` I wonder what you do believe in !
Just let me get at the creature ! ''
for he was as brave as a lion .
`` Hi !
Page , my chain-armour , helmet , lance , and buckler !
A Molinda !
A Molinda !
'' which was his war-cry .
The page ran to get the armour ; but it was so uncommonly hot that he dropped it , and put his fingers in his mouth , crying !
`` You had better put on flannels , Alphonso , for this kind of work , '' said Prigio .
`` And if I were you , I 'd take a light garden-engine , full of water , to squirt at the enemy . ''
`` Happy thought ! ''
said Alphonso .
`` I will ! ''
And off he went , kissed his dear Molinda , bade her keep a lot of dances for him , there was to be a dance when he had killed the Firedrake , and then he rushed to the field !
But he never came back any more !
Everyone wept bitterly -- everyone but Prince Prigio ; for he thought it was a practical joke , and said that Alphonso had taken the opportunity to start off on his travels and see the world .
`` There is some dreadful mistake , sir , '' said Prigio to the king .
`` You know as well as I do that the youngest son has always succeeded , up to now .
But I entertain great hopes of Enrico ! ''
And he grinned ; for he fancied it was all nonsense , and that there were no Firedrakes .
Enrico was present when Prigio was consoling the king in this unfeeling way .
`` Enrico , my boy , '' said his majesty , `` the task awaits you , and the honour .
When you come back with the horns and tail of the Fire-drake , you shall be crown prince ; and Prigio shall be made an usher at the Grammar School -- it is all he is fit for . ''
Enrico was not quite so confident as Alphonso had been .
He insisted on making his will ; and he wrote a poem about the pleasures and advantages of dying young .
This is part of it : The violet is a blossom sweet , That droops before the day is done -- Slain by thine overpowering heat , O Sun !
And I , like that sweet purple flower , May roast , or boil , or broil , or bake , If burned by thy terrific power , Firedrake !
This poem comforted Enrico more or less , and he showed it to Prigio .
But the prince only laughed , and said that the second line of the last verse was not very good ; for violets do not `` roast , or boil , or broil , or bake . ''
Enrico tried to improve it , but could not .
So he read it to his cousin , Lady Kathleena , just as it was ; and she cried over it , though I don't think she understood it ; and Enrico cried a little , too .
However , next day he started , with a spear , a patent refrigerator , and a lot of the bottles people throw at fires to put them out .
But he never came back again !
After shedding torrents of tears , the king summoned Prince Prigio to his presence .
`` Dastard ! ''
he said .
`` Poltroon !
Your turn , which should have come first , has arrived at last .
You must fetch me the horns and the tail of the Fired rake .
Probably you will be grilled , thank goodness ; but who will give me back Enrico and Alphonso ? ''
`` Indeed , your majesty , '' said Prigio , `` you must permit me to correct your policy .
Your only reason for dispatching your sons in pursuit of this dangerous but I believe fabulous animal , was to ascertain which of us would most worthily succeed to your throne , at the date -- long may it be deferred !
-- of your lamented decease .
Now , there can be no further question about the matter .
I , unworthy as I am , represent the sole hope of the royal family .
Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were * both dangerous and unnecessary .
Dangerous , because , if he treats me as you say he did my brothers -- my unhappy brothers , -- the throne of Pantouflia will want an heir .
But , if I do come back alive -- why , I can not be more the true heir than I am at present ; now can I ?
Ask the Lord Chief Justice , if you don't believe me . ''
* Subjunctive mood !
He was a great grammarian !
These arguments were so clearly and undeniably correct that the king , unable to answer them , withdrew into a solitary place where he could express himself with freedom , and give rein to his passions .
-- How Prince Prigio was deserted by Everybody MEANWHILE , Prince Prigio had to suffer many unpleasant things .
Though he was the crown prince , and though his arguments were unanswerable , everybody shunned him for a coward .
The queen , who did not believe in Firedrakes , alone took his side .
He was not only avoided by all , but he had most disagreeable scenes with his own cousins , Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena .
In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking alone , and did not bow to him .
`` Dear Molly , '' said the prince , who liked her , `` how have I been so unfortunate as to offend you ? ''
`` My name , sir , is Lady Molinda , '' she said , very proudly ; `` and you have sent your own brother to his grave ! ''
`` Oh , excuse me , '' said the prince , `` I am certain he has merely gone off on his travels .
He'll come back when he's tired : there are no Firedrakes ; a French writer says they are ` purement fabuleux , purely fabulous , you know . ''
`` Prince Alphonso has gone on his travels , and will come back when he is tired !
And was he then -- tired -- of me ? ''
cried poor Molinda , bursting into tears , and forgetting her dignity .
`` Oh !
I beg your pardon , I never noticed ; I 'm sure I am very sorry , '' cried the prince , who , never having been in love himself , never thought of other people .
And he tried to take Molinda's hand , but she snatched it from him and ran away through the garden to the palace , leaving Prince Prigio to feel foolish , for once , and ashamed .
As for Lady Kathleena , she swept past him like a queen , without a word .
So the prince , for all his cleverness , was not happy .
After several days had gone by , the king returned from the solitary place where he had been speaking his mind .
He now felt calmer and better ; and so at last he came back to the palace .
But on seeing Prince Prigio , who was lolling in a hammock , translating Egyptian hieroglyphs into French poetry for his mother , the king broke out afresh , and made use of the most cruel and impolite expressions .
At last , he gave orders that all the Court should pack up and move to a distant city ; and that Prince Prigio should be left alone in the palace by himself .
For he was quite unendurable , the king said , and he could not trust his own temper when he thought of him .
And he grew so fierce , that even the queen was afraid of him now .
The poor queen cried a good deal ; Prigio being her favourite son , on account of his acknowledged ability and talent .
But the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio behind .
For his part , he , very good-naturedly , showed them the best and shortest road to Falkenstein , the city where they were going ; and easily proved that neither the chief secretary for geography , nor the general of the army , knew anything about the matter -- which , indeed , they did not .
The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells , for they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day .
He therefore reminded them of this little fact in future history , which made them feel uncomfortable enough , and then lay down in his hammock and went to sleep .
When he wakened , the air was cold and the day was beginning to grow dark .
Prince Prigio thought he would go down and dine at a tavern in the town , for no servants had been left with him .
But what was his annoyance when he found that his boots , his sword , his cap , his cloak -- all his clothes , in fact , except those he wore , -- had been taken away by the courtiers , merely to spite him !
His wardrobe had been ransacked , and everything that had not been carried off had been cut up , burned , and destroyed .
Never was such a spectacle of wicked mischief .
It was as if hay had been made of everything he possessed .
What was worse , he had not a penny in his pocket to buy new things ; and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month .
Can you imagine anything more cruel and unjust than this conduct ?
for it was not the prince's fault that he was so clever .
The cruel fairy had made him so .
But , even if the prince had been born clever , as may have happened to you , was he to be blamed for that ?
The other people were just as much in fault for being born so stupid ; but the world , my dear children , can never be induced to remember this .
If you are clever , you will find it best not to let people know it -- if you want them to like you .
Well , here was the prince in a pretty plight .
Not a pound in his pocket , not a pair of boots to wear , not even a cap to cover his head from the rain ; nothing but cold meat to eat , and never a servant to answer the bell .
THE prince walked from room to room of the palace ; but , unless he wrapped himself up in a curtain , there was nothing for him to wear when he went out in the rain .
At last he climbed up a turret-stair in the very oldest part of the castle , where he had never been before ; and at the very top was a little round room , a kind of garret .
The prince pushed in the door with some difficulty -- not that it was locked , but the handle was rusty , and the wood had swollen with the damp .
The room was very dark ; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window , one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times .
But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the floor and on the table .
There were two caps ; he put one on -- an old , grey , ugly cap it was , made of felt .
There was a pair of boots ; and he kicked off his slippers , and got into them .
They were a good deal worn , but fitted as if they had been made for him .
On the table was a purse with just three gold coins -- old ones , too -- in it ; and this , as you may fancy , the prince was very well pleased to put in his pocket .
A sword , with a sword-belt , he buckled about his waist ; and the rest of the articles , a regular collection of odds and ends , he left just where they were lying .
Then he ran downstairs , and walked out of the hall door .
-- What Happened to Prince Prigio in Town BY this time the prince was very hungry .
The town was just three miles off ; but he had such a royal appetite , that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery , and the people of the royal town were bad cooks .
`` I wish I were in ` The Bear , ' at Gluck-stein , '' said he to himself ; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there .
But , then , the town was twenty-one leagues away -- sixty-three long miles !
No sooner had the prince said this , and taken just three steps , than he found himself at the door of the `` Bear Inn '' at Gluckstein !
`` This is the most extraordinary dream , '' said he to himself ; for he was far too clever , of course , to believe in seven-league boots .
Yet he had a pair on at that very moment , and it was they which had carried him in three strides from the palace to Gluckstein !
The truth is , that the prince , in looking about the palace for clothes , had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother , who did not believe in them .
But this , of course , the prince did not know .
Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you say you want to go a long distance .
Otherwise they would be very inconvenient -- when you only want to cross the room , for example .
Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess ?
Well , the prince walked into `` The Bear , '' and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him .
And yet his face was as well known as that of any man in Pantouflia ; for everybody had seen it , at least in pictures .
He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual , that he quite forgot to take off his cap .
He sat down at a table , however , and shouted '' Kellner !
'' at which all the waiters jumped , and looked round in every direction , but nobody came to him .
At first he thought they were too busy , but presently another explanation occurred to him .
`` The king , '' said he to himself , `` has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me , or helps me in any way .
Well , I don't mean to starve in the midst of plenty , anyhow ; here goes ! ''
The prince rose , and went to the table in the midst of the room , where a huge roast turkey had just been placed .
He helped himself to half the breast , some sausages , chestnut stuffing , bread sauce , potatoes , and a bottle of red wine -- Burgundy .
He then went back to a table in a corner , where he dined very well , nobody taking any notice of him .
When he had finished , he sat watching the other people dining , and smoking his cigarette .
As he was sitting thus , a very tall man , an officer in the uniform of the Guards , came in , and , walking straight to the prince's table , said : `` Kellner , clean this table , and bring in the bill of fare . ''
With these words , the officer sat down suddenly in the prince's lap , as if he did not see him at all .
He was a heavy man , and the prince , enraged at the insult , pushed him away and jumped to his feet .
As he did so , his cap dropped off .
The officer fell on his knees at once , crying : `` Pardon , my prince , pardon !
I never saw you ! ''
This was more than the prince could be expected to believe .
`` Nonsense !
Count Frederick von Matterhorn , '' he said ; `` you must be intoxicated .
Sir !
you have insulted your prince and your superior officer .
Consider yourself under arrest !
You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow . ''
On this , the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern .
They all declared that they had not seen the prince , nor ever had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town .
More and more offended , and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him , the prince shouted for the landlord , called for his bill , threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change , and went into the street .
`` It is a disgraceful conspiracy , '' he said .
`` The king shall answer for this !
I shall write to the newspapers at once ! ''
He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him in the street .
They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him , and then staggered back in the greatest surprise , looking in every direction for the person they had jostled .
In one of these encounters , the prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down .
As he was usually most kind and polite , he pulled off his cap to beg her pardon , when , behold , the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream , and fainted !
A crowd was collecting , and the prince , forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in the tavern , pulled out his purse .
Then he remembered what he had done , and expected to find it empty ; but , lo , there were three pieces of gold in it !
Overcome with surprise , he thrust the money into the woman's hand , and put on his cap again .
In a moment the crowd , which had been staring at him , rushed away in every direction , with cries of terror , declaring that there was a magician in the town , and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure !
By this time , you or I , or anyone who was not so extremely clever as Prince Prigio , would have understood what was the matter .
He had put on , without knowing it , not only the seven-league boots , but the cap of darkness , and had taken Fortunatus's purse , which could never be empty , however often you took all the money out .
All those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening , and the prince had found them in the dark garret .
But the prince was so extremely wise , and learned , and scientific , that he did not believe in fairies , nor in fairy gifts .
`` It is indigestion , '' he said to himself : `` those sausages were not of the best ; and that Burgundy was extremely strong .
Things are not as they appear . ''
Here , as he was arguing with himself , he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six , the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him .
Annoyed at this , the prince leaped up behind , threw down the two footmen , who made no resistance , and so was carried to the door of a magnificent palace .
He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was in the carriage ; but , noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady with him , whom he had never seen before , he followed them into the house , not wishing to alarm the girl , and meaning to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone .
A great ball was going on ; but , as usual , nobody took any notice of the prince .
He walked among the guests , being careful not to jostle them , and listening to their conversation .
It was all about himself !
Everyone had heard of his disgrace , and almost everyone cried `` Serve him right ! ''
They said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurable -- that nothing was more rude than to be always in the right -- that cleverness might be carried far too far -- that it was better even to be born stupid , `` Like the rest of you , '' thought the prince ; and , in fact , nobody had a good word for him .
Yes , one had !
It was the pretty lady of the carriage .
I never could tell you how pretty she was .
She was tall , with cheeks like white roses blushing : she had dark hair , and very large dark-grey eyes , and her face was the kindest in the world !
The prince first thought how nice and good she looked , even before he thought how pretty she looked .
She stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him .
She had never seen the prince , for she was but newly come to Pantouflia ; but she declared that it was his misfortune , not his fault , to be so clever .
`` And , then , think how hard they made him work at school !
Besides , '' said this kind young lady , `` I hear he is extremely handsome , and very brave ; and he has a good heart , for he was kind , I have heard , to a poor boy , and did all his examination papers for him , so that the boy passed first in everything .
And now he is Minister for Education , though he can't do a line of Greek prose ! ''
The prince blushed at this , for he knew his conduct had not been honourable .
But he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young lady , a thing he had never done in his life before , because -- he said -- `` women were so stupid ! ''
You see he was so clever !
Now , at this very moment -- when the prince , all of a sudden , was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room -- an extraordinary thing happened !
Something seemed to give a whirr !
in his brain , and in one instant he knew all about it !
He believed in fairies and fairy gifts , and understood that his cap was the cap of darkness , and his shoes the seven-league boots , and his purse the purse of Fortunatus !
He had read about those things in historical books : but now he believed in them .
-- The Prince Falls in Love HE understood all this , and burst out laughing , which nearly frightened an old lady near him out of her wits .
Ah !
how he wished he was only in evening dress , that he might dance with the charming young lady .
But there he was , dressed just as if he were going out to hunt , if anyone could have seen him .
So , even if he took off his cap of darkness , and became visible , he was no figure for a ball .
Once he would not have cared , but now he cared very much indeed .
But the prince was not clever for nothing .
He thought for a moment , then went out of the room , and , in three steps of the seven-league boots , was at his empty , dark , cold palace again .
He struck a light with a flint and steel , lit a torch , and ran upstairs to the garret .
The flaring light of the torch fell on the pile of `` rubbish , '' as the queen would have called it , which he turned over with eager hands .
Was there -- yes , there was another cap !
There it lay , a handsome green one with a red feather .
The prince pulled off the cap of darkness , put on the other , and said : '' I wish I were dressed in my best suit of white and gold , with the royal Pantouflia diamonds !
'' In one moment there he was in white and gold , the greatest and most magnificent dandy in the whole world , and the handsomest man !
`` How about my boots , I wonder , '' said the prince ; for his seven-league boots were stout riding-boots , not good to dance in , whereas now he was in elegant shoes of silk and gold .
He threw down the wishing cap , put on the other -- the cap of darkness -- and made three strides in the direction of Gluckstein .
But he was only three steps nearer it than he had been , and the seven-league boots were standing beside him on the floor !
`` No , '' said the prince ; `` no man can be in two different pairs of boots at one and the same time !
That's mathematics ! ''
He then hunted about in the lumber-room again till he found a small , shabby , old Persian carpet , the size of a hearthrug .
He went to his own room , took a portmanteau in his hand , sat down on the carpet , and said : `` I wish I were in Gluckstein . ''
In a moment there he found himself ; for this was that famous carpet which Prince Hussein bought long ago , in the market at Bisnagar , and which the fairies had brought , with the other presents , to the christening of Prince Prigio .
When he arrived at the house where the ball was going on , he put the magical carpet in the portmanteau , and left it in the cloakroom , receiving a numbered ticket in exchange .
Then he marched in all his glory , and , of course , without the cap of darkness , into the room where they were dancing .
Everybody made place for him , bowing down to the ground , and the loyal band struck up The Prince's March : Heaven bless our Prince Prigio !
What is there he doesn't know ?
Greek , Swiss , German , High and Low , And the names of the mountains in Mexico , Heaven bless the prince !
He used to be very fond of this march , and the words -- some people even said he had made them himself .
But now , somehow , he didn't much like it .
He went straight to the Duke of Stumpfelbahn , the Hereditary Master of the Ceremonies , and asked to be introduced to the beautiful young lady .
She was the daughter of the new English Ambassador , and her name was Lady Rosalind .
But she nearly fainted when she heard who it was that wished to dance with her , for she was not at all particularly clever ; and the prince had such a bad character for snubbing girls , and asking them difficult questions .
However , it was impossible to refuse , and so she danced with the prince , and he danced very well .
Then they sat out in the conservatory , among the flowers , where nobody came near them ; and then they danced again , and then the Prince took her down to supper .
And all the time he never once said , `` Have you read this ?
'' or `` Have you read that ?
'' or , `` What !
you never heard of Alexander the Great ? ''
or Julius Caesar , or Michael Angelo , or whoever it might be -- horrid , difficult questions he used to ask .
That was the way he used to go on : but now he only talked to the young lady about herself ; and she quite left off being shy or frightened , and asked him all about his own country , and about the Firedrake shooting , and said how fond she was of hunting herself .
And the prince said : `` Oh , if you wish it , you shall have the horns and tail of a Firedrake to hang up in your hall , to-morrow evening ! ''
Then she asked if it was not very dangerous work , Firedrake hunting ; and he said it was nothing , when you knew the trick of it : and he asked her if she would but give him a rose out of her bouquet ; and , in short , he made himself so agreeable and unaffected , that she thought him very nice indeed .
For , even a clever person can be nice when he likes -- above all , when he is not thinking about himself .
And now the prince was thinking of nothing in the world but the daughter of the English Ambassador , and how to please her-He got introduced to her father too , and quite won his heart ; and , at last , he was invited to dine next day at the Embassy .
In Pantouflia , it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the royal family goes on dancing .
This ball lasted till the light came in , and the birds were singing out of doors , and all the mothers present were sound asleep .
Then nothing would satisfy the prince , but that they all should go home singing through the streets ; in fact , there never had been so merry a dance in all Pantouflia .
The prince had made a point of dancing with almost every girl there : and he had suddenly become the most beloved of the royal family .
But everything must end at last ; and the prince , putting on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet , flew back to his lonely castle .
PRINCE PRIGIO did not go to bed .
It was bright daylight , and he had promised to bring the horns and tail of a Firedrake as a present to a pretty lady .
He had said it was easy to do this ; but now , as he sat and thought over it , he did not feel so victorious .
`` First , '' he said , `` where is the Firedrake ? ''
He reflected for a little , and then ran upstairs to the garret .
`` It should be here ! ''
he cried , tossing the fairies ' gifts about ; `` and , by George , here it is ! ''
Indeed , he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which Prince Ali , in the Arabian Nights , bought in the bazaar in Schiraz .
Now , this glass was made so that , by looking through it , you could see anybody or anything you wished , however far away .
Prigio's first idea was to look at his lady .
`` But she does not expect to be looked at , '' he thought ; `` and I won't !
'' On the other hand , he determined to look at the Firedrake ; for , of course , he had no delicacy about spying on him , the brute .
The prince clapped the glass to his eye , stared out of window , and there , sure enough , he saw the Firedrake .
He was floating about in a sea of molten lava , on the top of a volcano .
There he was , swimming and diving for pleasure , tossing up the flaming waves , and blowing fountains of fire out of his nostrils , like a whale spouting !
The prince did not like the looks of him .
`` With all my cap of darkness , and my shoes of swiftness , and my sword of sharpness , I never could get near that beast , '' he said ; `` and if I did stalk him , I could not hurt him .
Poor little Alphonso !
poor Enrico !
what plucky fellows they were !
I fancied that there was no such thing as a Firedrake : he's not in the Natural History books ; and I thought the boys were only making fun , and would be back soon , safe and sound .
How horrid being too clever makes one !
And now , what am I to do ? ''
What was he to do , indeed ?
And what would you have done ?
Bring the horns and tail he must , or perish in the adventure .
Otherwise , how could he meet his lady ?
-- why , she would think him a mere braggart .
The prince sat down , and thought and thought ; and the day went on , and it was now high noon .
At last he jumped up and rushed into the library , a room where nobody ever went except himself and the queen .
There he turned the books upside down , in his haste , till he found an old one , by a French gentleman , Monsieur Cyrano de Bergerac .
It was an account of a voyage to the moon , in which there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known ; for few travellers have been to the moon .
In that book , Prince Prigio fancied he would find something he half remembered , and that would be of use to him .
And he did !
So you see that cleverness , and minding your book , have some advantages , after all .
For here the prince learned that there is a very rare beast called a Remora , which is at least as cold as the Firedrake is hot !
`` Now , '' thought he , '' if I can only make these two fight , why the Remora may kill the Firedrake , or take the heat out of him , at least , so that I may have a chance . ''
Then he seized the ivory glass , clapped it to his eye , and looked for the Remora .
Just the tip of his nose , as white as snow and as smooth as ice , was sticking out of a chink in a frozen mountain , not far from the burning mountain of the Firedrake .
`` Hooray ! ''
said the prince softly to himself ; and he jumped like mad into the winged shoes of swiftness , stuck on the cap of darkness , girdled himself with the sword of sharpness , and put a good slice of bread , with some cold tongue , in a wallet , which he slung on his back .
Never you fight , if you can help it , except with plenty of food to keep you going and in good heart .
Then off he flew , and soon he reached the volcano of the Firedrake .
IT was dreadfully hot , even high up in the air , where the prince hung invisible .
Great burning stones were tossed up by the volcano , and nearly hit him several times .
Moreover , the steam and smoke , and the flames which the Firedrake spouted like foam from his nostrils , would have daunted even the bravest man .
The sides of the hill , too , were covered with the blackened ashes of his victims , whom he had roasted when they came out to kill him .
The garden-engine of poor little Alphonso was lying in the valley , all broken and useless .
But the Firedrake , as happy as a wild duck on a lonely lock , was rolling and diving in the liquid flame , all red-hot and full of frolic .
`` Hi ! ''
shouted the prince .
The Firedrake rose to the surface , his horns as red as a red crescent-moon , only bigger , and lashing the fire with his hoofs and his blazing tail .
`` Who's there ? ''
he said in a hoarse , angry voice .
`` Just let me get at you ! ''
`` It's me , '' answered the prince .
It was the first time he had forgotten his grammar , but he was terribly excited .
`` What do you want ? ''
grunted the beast .
`` I wish I could see you '' ; and , horrible to relate , he rose on a pair of wide , flaming wings , and came right at the prince , guided by the sound of his voice .
Now , the prince had never heard that Fire-drakes could fly ; indeed , he had never believed in them at all , till the night before .
For a moment he was numb with terror ; then he flew down like a stone to the very bottom of the hill and shouted : `` Hi ! ''
`` Well , '' grunted the Firedrake , `` what's the matter ?
Why can't you give a civil answer to a civil question ? ''
`` Will you go back to your hole and swear , on your honour as a Firedrake , to listen quietly ? ''
`` On my sacred word of honour , '' said the beast , casually scorching an eagle that flew by into ashes .
The cinders fell , jingling and crackling , round the prince in a little shower .
Then the Firedrake dived back , with an awful splash of flame , and the mountain roared round him .
The prince now flew high above him , and cried : `` A message from the Remora .
He says you are afraid to fight him . ''
`` Don't know him , '' grunted the Firedrake .
`` He sends you his glove , '' said Prince Prigio , `` as a challenge to mortal combat , till death do you part . ''
Then he dropped his own glove into the fiery lake .
`` Does he ? ''
yelled the Firedrake .
`` Just let me get at him ! ''
and he scrambled out , all red-hot as he was .
`` I'll go and tell him you 're coming , '' said the prince ; and with two strides he was over the frozen mountain of the Remora .
If he had been too warm before , the prince was too cold now .
The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel , and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast , which indeed it was .
All around were things like marble statues of men in armour : they were the dead bodies of the knights , horses and all , who had gone out of old to fight the Remora , and who had been frosted up by him .
The prince felt his blood stand still , and he grew faint ; but he took heart , for there was no time to waste .
Yet he could nowhere see the Remora .
`` Hi ! ''
shouted the prince .
Then , from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth , black hill , -- a chink no deeper than that under a door , but a mile wide , -- stole out a hideous head !
It was as fiat as the head of a skate-fish , it was deathly pale , and two chill-blue eyes , dead-coloured like stones , looked out of it .
Then there came a whisper , like the breath of the bitter east wind on a wintry day : `` Where are you , and how can I come to you ? ''
`` Here I am ! ''
said the prince from the top of the hill .
Then the flat , white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped , and slowly , like the movement of a sheet of ice , it slipped upwards and curled upwards , and up , and up !
There seemed no end to it at all ; and it moved horribly , without feet , holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill .
Now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth , flat shiny coils ; and still the head was higher than the rest ; and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer , like Death .
The prince almost fainted : everything seemed to swim ; and in one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top , and the white head would have crawled over him , and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone .
And still the thing slipped up , from the chink under the mountain .
But the prince made a great effort ; he moved , and in two steps he was far away , down in the valley where it was not so very cold .
`` Hi ! ''
he shouted , as soon as his tongue could move within his chattering teeth .
There came a clear , hissing answer , like frozen words dropping round him : `` Wait till I come down .
What do you want ? ''
Then the white folds began to slide , like melting ice , from the black hill .
Prince Prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him , and colder in front of him .
He looked round , and there were the trees beginning to blacken in the heat , and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the plains ; for the Firedrake was coming !
The prince just took time to shout , `` The Firedrake is going to pay you a visit ! ''
and then he soared to the top of a neighbouring hill , and looked on at what followed .
IT was an awful sight to behold !
When the Remora heard the name of the Firedrake , his hated enemy , he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley .
On and on and on he poured over rock and tree , as if a frozen river could slide downhill ; on and on , till there were miles of him stretching along the valley -- miles of the smooth-ribbed , icy creature , crawling and slipping forwards .
The green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced ; the birds fell down dead from the sky , slain by his frosty breath !
But , fast as the Remora stole forward , the Firedrake came quicker yet , flying and clashing his fiery wings .
At last they were within striking distance ; and the Firedrake , stooping from the air , dashed with his burning horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the Remora .
Then there rose a steam so dreadful , such a white yet fiery vapour of heat , that no one who had not the prince's magic glass could have seen what happened .
With horrible grunts and roars the Firedrake tried to burn his way right through the flat body of the Remora , and to chase him to his cleft in the rock .
But the Remora , hissing terribly , and visibly melting away in places , yet held his ground ; and the prince could see his cold white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the Firedrake -- up and up , till they reached his knees , and the great burning beast roared like a hundred bulls with the pain .
Then up the Firedrake leaped , and hovering on his fiery wings , he lighted in the midst of the Remora's back , and dashed into it with his horns .
But the flat , cruel head writhed backwards , and , slowly bending over on itself , the wounded Remora slid greedily to fasten again on the limbs of the Firedrake .
Meanwhile , the prince , safe on his hill , was lunching on the loaf and the cold tongue he had brought with him .
`` Go it , Remora !
Go it , Firedrake !
you 're gaining .
Give it him , Remora ! ''
he shouted in the wildest excitement .
Nobody had ever seen such a battle ; he had it all to himself , and he never enjoyed anything more .
He hated the Remora so much , that he almost wished the Firedrake could beat it ; for the Firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair .
Still , he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards , backwards , into the cleft below the hill ; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered .
But the Firedrake , too , was in an unhappy way ; for his legs were now cold and black , his horns were black also , though his body , especially near the heart , glowed still like red-hot iron .
`` Go it , Remora ! ''
cried the prince : `` his legs are giving way ; he's groggy on his pins !
One more effort , and he won't be able to move ! ''
Encouraged by this advice , the white , slippery Remora streamed out of his cavern again , more and more of him uncoiling , as if the mountain were quite full of him .
He had lost strength , no doubt : for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds , and the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter ; but so did the roars of the Firedrake .
Presently they sounded more like groans ; and at last the Remora slipped up his legs above the knees , and fastened on his very heart of fire .
Then the Firedrake stood groaning like a black bull , knee-deep in snow ; and still the Remora climbed and climbed .
`` Go it now , Firedrake ! ''
shouted the prince ; for he knew that if the Remora won , it would be too cold for him to draw near the place , and cut off the Firedrake's head and tail .
`` Go it , Drake !
he's slackening ! ''
cried the prince again ; and the brave Firedrake made one last furious effort , and rising on his wings , dropped just on the spine of his enemy .
The wounded Remora curled back his head again on himself , and again crawled , steaming terribly , towards his enemy .
But the struggle was too much for the gallant Remora .
The flat , cruel head moved slower ; the steam from his thousand wounds grew fiercer ; and he gently breathed his last just as the Firedrake , too , fell over and lay exhausted .
With one final roar , like the breath of a thousand furnaces , the Firedrake expired .
The prince , watching from the hill-top , could scarcely believe that these two awful scourges of Nature , which had so long devastated his country , were actually dead .
But when he had looked on for half-an-hour , and only a river ran where the Remora had been , while the body of the Firedrake lay stark and cold , he hurried to the spot .
Drawing the sword of sharpness , he hacked off , at two blows , the iron head and the tail of the Firedrake .
They were a weary weight to carry ; but in a few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle , where he threw down his burden , and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue .
But the castle clock struck half-past seven ; dinner was at eight , and the poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the garret .
Here he put on the wishing-cap ; wished for a pint of champagne , a hot bath , and his best black velvet and diamond suit .
In a moment these were provided ; he bathed , dressed , drank a glass of wine , packed up the head and tail of the Firedrake ; sat down on the flying carpet , and knocked at the door of the English Ambassador as the clocks were striking eight ' in Gluckstein .
Punctuality is the politeness of princes ; and a prince is polite when he is in love !
The prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led into the hall , where several butlers met him , and he laid the mortal remains of the Firedrake under the cover of the flying carpet .
Then he was led upstairs , and he made his bow to the pretty lady , who , of course , made him a magnificent courtesy .
She seemed prettier and kinder than ever .
The prince was so happy , that he never noticed how something went wrong about the dinner .
The ambassador looked about , and seemed to miss someone , and spoke in a low voice to one of the servants , who answered also in a low voice , and what he said seemed to displease the ambassador .
But the prince was so busy in talking to his lady , and in eating his dinner too , that he never observed anything unusual .
He had never been at such a pleasant dinner !
WHEN the ladies left , and the prince and the other gentlemen were alone , the ambassador appeared more gloomy than ever .
At last he took the prince into a corner , on pretence of showing him a rare statue .
`` Does your royal highness not know , '' he asked , `` that you are in considerable danger ? ''
`` Still ? ''
said the prince , thinking of the Firedrake .
The ambassador did not know what he meant , for he had never heard of the fight , but he answered gravely : `` Never more than now . ''
Then he showed the prince two proclamations , which had been posted all about the town .
Here is the first : TO ALL LOYAL SUBJECTS .
Whereas , Our eldest son , Prince Prigio , hath of late been guilty of several high crimes and misdemeanours .
First : By abandoning the post of danger against the Firedrake , whereby our beloved sons , Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico , have perished , and been overdone by that monster .
Secondly : By attending an unseemly revel in the town of Gluckstein , where he brawled in the streets .
Thirdly : By trying to seduce away the hearts of our loyal subjects in that city , and to blow up a party against our crown and our peace .
This is to give warning , That whoever consorts with , comforts , aids , or abets the said Prince Prigio , is thereby a partner in his treason ; and That a reward of Five Thousand Purses will be given to whomsoever brings the said prince , alive , to our Castle of Falkenstein .
Grognio R. And here is the second proclamation : Reward .
The firedrake .
Whereas , Our dominions have lately been devastated by a Firedrake , the Salamander Furiosus of Buffon ; This is to advise all , That whosoever brings the horns and tail of the said Firedrake to our Castle of Falkenstein , shall receive Five Thousand Purses , the position of Crown Prince , with the usual perquisites , and the hand of the king's niece , the Lady Molinda .
Grognio R. `` H 'm , '' said the prince ; `` I did not think his majesty wrote so well ; '' and he would have liked to say , `` Don't you think we might join the ladies ? ''
`` But , sir , '' said the ambassador , `` the streets are lined with soldiers ; and I know not how you have escaped them .
Here , under my roof , you are safe for the moment ; but a prolonged stay -- excuse my inhospitality -- could not but strain the harmonious relations which prevail between the Government of Pantouflia and that which I have the honour to represent . ''
`` We don't want to fight ; and no more , I think , do you , '' said the prince , smiling .
`` Then how does your royal highness mean to treat the proclamations ? ''
`` Why , by winning these ten thousand purses .
I can tell you # 1,000,000 is worth having , '' said the prince .
`` I'll deliver up the said prince , alive , at Falkenstein this very night ; also the horns and tail of the said Firedrake .
But I don't want to marry my Cousin Molly . ''
`` May I remind your royal highness that Falkenstein is three hundred miles away ?
Moreover , my head butler , Benson , disappeared from the house before dinner , and I fear he went to warn Captain Kopzoffski that you are here !
'' `` That is nothing , '' said the prince ; `` but , my dear Lord Kelso , may I not have the pleasure of presenting Lady Rosalind with a little gift , a Philippine which I lost to her last night , merely the head and tail of a Firedrake which I stalked this morning ? ''
The ambassador was so astonished that he ran straight upstairs , forgetting his manners , and crying : `` Linda !
Linda !
come down at once ; here's a surprise for you ! ''
Lady Rosalind came sweeping down , with a smile on her kind face .
She guessed what it was , though the prince had said nothing about it at dinner .
`` Lead the way , your royal highness ! ''
cried the ambassador ; and the prince offering Lady Rosalind his arm , went out into the hall , where he saw neither his carpet nor the horns and tail of the Firedrake !
He turned quite pale , and said : `` Will you kindly ask the servants where the little Persian prayer-rug and the parcel which I brought with me have been placed ? ''
Lord Kelso rang the bell , and in came all the servants , with William , the under-butler , at their head .
`` William , '' said his lordship , `` where have you put his royal highness's parcel and his carpet ? ''
`` Please , your lordship , '' said William , `` we think Benson have took them away with him . ''
`` And where is Benson ? ''
`` We don't know , your lordship .
We think he have been come for ! ''
`` Come for -- by whom ? ''
William stammered , and seemed at a loss for a reply .
`` Quick !
answer !
what do you know about it ? ''
William said at last , rather as if he were making a speech : `` Your royaliness , and my lords and ladies , it was like this .
His royaliness comed in with a rug over his arm , and summat under it .
And he lays it down on that there seat , and Thomas shows him into the droring-room .
Then Benson says : ` Dinner'll be ready in five minutes ; how tired I do feel !
` Then he takes the libbuty of sitting hisself down on his royaliness's rug , and he says , asking your pardon , ' I've had about enough of service here .
I 'm about tired , and I thinks of bettering myself .
I wish I was at the king's court , and butler . '
But before the words was out of his mouth , off he flies like a shot through the open door , and his royaliness's parcel with him .
I run to the door , and there he was , flying right hover the town , in a northerly direction .
And that's all I know ; for I would not tell a lie , not if it was hever so .
And me , and Thomas -- as didn't see it , -- and cook , we thinks as how Benson was come for .
And cook says as she don't wonder at it , neither ; for a grumblinger , more ill-conditioneder -- '' `` Thank you , William , '' said Lord Kelso ; `` that will do ; you can go , for the present . ''
THE prince said nothing , the ambassador said nothing , Lady Rosalind said never a word till they were in the drawing-room .
It was a lovely warm evening , and the French windows were wide open on the balcony , which looked over the town and away north to the hills .
Below them flowed the clear , green water of the Gluckthal And still nobody said a word .
At last the prince spoke : `` This is a very strange story , Lord Kelso ! ''
`` Very , sir ! ''
said the ambassador .
`` But true , '' added the prince ; `` at least , there is no reason in the nature of things why it shouldn't be true . ''
`` I can hardly believe , sir , that the conduct of Benson , whom I always found a most respectable man , deserved -- '' `` That he should be ` come for , ' '' said the prince .
`` Oh , no ; it was a mere accident , and might have happened to any of us who chanced to sit down on my carpet . ''
And then the prince told them , shortly , all about it : how the carpet was one of a number of fairy properties , which had been given him at his christening ; and how so long a time had gone by before he discovered them ; and how , probably , the carpet had carried the butler where he had said he wanted to go -- namely , to the king's Court at Falkenstein .
`` It would not matter so much , '' added the prince , `` only I had relied on making my peace with his majesty , my father , by aid of those horns and that tail .
He was set on getting them ; and if the Lady Rosalind had not expressed a wish for them , they would to-day have been in his possession . ''
`` Oh , sir , you honour us too highly , '' murmured Lady Rosalind ; and the prince blushed and said : `` Not at all !
Impossible ! ''
Then , of course , the ambassador became quite certain that his daughter was admired by the crown prince , who was on bad terms with the king of the country ; and a more uncomfortable position for an ambassador -- however , they are used to them .
`` What on earth am I to do with the young man ? ''
he thought .
`` He can't stay here for ever ; and without his carpet he can't get away , for the soldiers have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the street .
And in the meantime Benson will be pretending that he killed the Firedrake -- for he must have got to Falkenstein by now , -- and they will be for marrying him to the king's niece , and making my butler crown prince to the kingdom of Pantouflia !
It is dreadful ! ''
Now all this time the prince was on the balcony , telling Lady Rosalind all about how he got the Firedrake done for , in the most modest way ; for , as he said : `` I didn't kill him : and it is really the Remora , poor fellow , who should marry Molly ; but he's dead . ''
At this very moment there was a whizz in the air ; something shot past them , and , through the open window , the king , the queen , Benson , and the mortal remains of the Firedrake were shot into the ambassador's drawing room !
THE first who recovered his voice and presence of mind was Benson .
`` Did your lordship ring for coffee ? ''
he asked , quietly ; and when he was told `` Yes , '' he bowed and withdrew , with majestic composure .
When he had gone , the prince threw himself at the king's feet , crying : `` Pardon , pardon , my liege ! ''
`` Don't speak to me , sir ! ''
answered the king , very angrily ; and the poor prince threw himself at the feet of the queen .
But she took no notice of him whatever , no more than if he had been a fairy ; and the prince heard her murmur , as she pinched her royal arms : `` I shall waken presently ; this is nothing out of the way for a dream .
Dr. Rumpfino ascribes it to imperfect nutrition . ''
All this time , the Lady Rosalind , as pale as a marble statue , was leaning against the side of the open window .
The prince thought he could do nothing wiser than go and comfort her , so he induced her to sit down on a chair in the balcony , -- for he felt that he was not wanted in the drawing-room ; -- and soon they were talking happily about the stars , which had begun to appear in the summer night .
Meanwhile , the ambassador had induced the king to take a seat ; but there was no use in talking to the queen .
`` It would be a miracle , '' she said to herself , `` and miracles do not happen ; therefore this has not happened .
Presently , I shall wake up in my own bed at Falkenstein . ''
Now , Benson , William , and Thomas brought in the coffee , but the queen took no notice .
When they went away , the rest of the company slipped off quietly , and the king was left alone with the ambassador ; for the queen could hardly be said to count .
`` You want to know all about it , I suppose ? ''
said his majesty in a sulky voice .
`` Well , you have a right to it , and I shall tell you .
We were just sitting down to dinner at Falkenstein , rather late , -- hours get later every year , I think -- when I heard a row in the premises , and the captain of the guard , Colonel McDougal , came and told us that a man had arrived with the horns and tail of the Firedrake , and was claiming the reward .
Her majesty and I rose and went into the outer court , where we found , sitting on that carpet with a glass of beer in his hand , a respectable-looking upper servant , whom I recognised as your butler .
He informed us that he had just killed the beast , and showed us the horns and tail , sure enough ; there they are !
The tail is like the iron handle of a pump , but the horns are genuine .
A pair were thrown up by a volcano , in my great-grandfather's time Giglio I. * Excellent coffee this , of yours ! ''
* The History of this Prince may be read in a treatise called The Rose and the Ring , by M. A. Titmarsh .
London , 1855 .
The ambassador bowed .
`` Well , we asked him where he killed the Firedrake , and he said in a garden near Gluckstein .
Then he began to speak about the reward , and the ` perkisits , ' as he called them , which it seems he had read about in my proclamation .
Rather a neat thing ; drew it up myself , '' added his majesty .
`` Very much to the point , '' said the ambassador , wondering what the king was coming to .
`` Glad you like it , '' said the king , much pleased .
`` Well , where was I ?
Oh , yes ; your man said he had killed the creature in a garden , quite near Gluckstein .
I didn't much like the whole affair : he is an alien , you see ; and then there was my niece , Molinda -- poor girl , she was certain to give trouble .
Her heart is buried , if I may say so , with poor Alphonso .
But the queen is a very remarkable woman -- very remarkable -- '' `` Very ! ''
said the ambassador , with perfect truth . ''
` Caitiff ! '
she cries to your butler , '' his majesty went on ; '' ` perjured knave , thou liest in thy throat !
Gluckstein is a hundred leagues from here , and how say est thou that thou slewest the molester , and earnest hither in a few hours ' space ? '
This had not occurred to me , -- I am a plain king , but I at once saw the force of her majesty's argument .
Yes , ' said I ; ` how did you manage it ? '
But he -- your man , I mean -- was not a bit put out .
` Why , your majesty , ' says he , ' I just sat down on that there bit of carpet , wished I was here , and here I ham .
And I 'd be glad , having had the trouble , -- and my time not being my own , -- to see the colour of them perkisits , according to the proclamation . '
On this her majesty grew more indignant , if possible .
` Nonsense ! '
she cried ; ' a story out of the ` Arabian Nights ' is not suited for a modern public , and fails to win æsthetic credence . '
These were her very words . ''
`` Her majesty's expressions are ever choice and appropriate , '' said the ambassador . ''
` Sit down there , on the carpet , knave , ' she went on ; ` ourself and consort ' -- meaning me -- ` will take our places by thy side , and I shall wish us in Gluckstein , at thy master's !
When the experiment has failed , thy head shall from thy shoulders be shorn ! '
So your man merely said , ` Very well , mum , -- your majesty , I mean , ' and sat down .
The queen took her place at the edge of the carpet ; I sat between her and the butler , and she said , ' I wish I were in Gluckstein ! '
Then we rose , flew through the air at an astonishing pace , and here we are !
So I suppose the rest of the butler's tale is true , which I regret ; but a king's word is sacred , and he shall take the place of that sneak , Prigio .
But as we left home before dinner , and yours is over , may I request your lordship to believe that I should be delighted to take something cold ? ''
The ambassador at once ordered a sumptuous collation , to which the king did full justice ; and his majesty was shown to the royal chamber , as he complained of fatigue .
The queen accompanied him , remarking that she was sound asleep , but would waken presently .
Neither of them said `` Good-night '' to the prince .
Indeed , they did not see him again , for he was on the balcony with Lady Rosalind .
They found a great deal to say to each other , and at last the prince asked her to be his wife ; and she said that if the king and her father gave their permission -- why , then she would !
After this she went to bed ; and the prince , who had not slept at all the night before , felt very sleepy also .
But he knew that first he had something that must be done .
So he went into the drawing-room , took his carpet , and wished to be -- now where do you suppose ?
Beside the dead body of the Firedrake !
There he was in a moment ; and dreadful the body looked , lying stark and cold in the white moonshine .
Then the prince cut off its four hoofs , put them in his wallet , and with these he flew back in a second , and met the ambassador just as he came from ushering the king to bed .
Then the prince was shown his own room , where he locked up the hoofs , the carpet , the cap of darkness , and his other things in an iron box ; and so he went to bed and dreamed of his Lady Rosalind .
WHEN they all awakened next morning , their first ideas were confused .
It is often confusing to wake in a strange bed , much more so when you have flown through the air , like the king , the queen , and Benson the butler .
For her part , the queen was the most perplexed of all ; for she did undeniably wake , and yet she was not at home , where she had expected to be .
However , she was a determined woman , and stood to it that nothing unusual was occurring .
The butler made up his mind to claim the crown princeship and the hand of the Lady Molinda ; because , as he justly remarked to William , here was such a chance to better himself as might not soon come in his way again .
As for the king , he was only anxious to get back to Falkenstein , and have the whole business settled in a constitutional manner .
The ambassador was not sorry to get rid of the royal party ; and it was proposed that they should all sit down on the flying carpet , and wish themselves at home again .
But the queen would not hear of it : she said it was childish and impossible ; so the carriage was got ready for her , and she started without saying a word of good-bye to anyone .
The king , Benson , and the prince were not so particular , and they simply flew back to Falkenstein in the usual way , arriving there at 11.35 -- a week before her majesty .
The king at once held a Court ; the horns and tail of the monster were exhibited amidst general interest , and Benson and the prince were invited to state their claims .
Benson's evidence was taken first .
He declined to say exactly where or how he killed the Firedrake .
There might be more of them left , he remarked , -- young ones , that would take a lot of killing , -- and he refused to part with his secret .
Only he claimed the reward , which was offered , if you remember , not to the man who killed the beast , but to him wha brought its horns and tail .
This was allowed by the lawyers present to be very sound law ; and Benson was cheered by the courtiers , who decidedly preferred him to Prigio , and who , besides , thought he was going to be crown prince .
As for Lady Molinda , she was torn by the most painful feelings ; for , much as she hated Prigio , she could not bear the idea of marrying Benson .
Yet one or the other choice seemed certain .
Unhappy lady !
Perhaps no girl was ever more strangely beset by misfortune !
Prince Prigio was now called on to speak .
He admitted that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail , not for killing the monster .
But were the king's intentions to go for nothing ?
When a subject only meant well , of course he had to suffer ; but when a king said one thing , was he not to be supposed to have meant another ?
Any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail ; the difficult thing was to kill the monster .
If Benson's claim was allowed , the royal prerogative of saying one thing and meaning something else was in danger .
On hearing this argument , the king so far forgot himself as to cry , `` Bravo , well said ! ''
and to clap his hands , whereon all the courtiers shouted and threw up their hats .
The prince then said that whoever had killed the monster could , of course , tell where to find him , and could bring his hoofs .
He was ready to do this himself .
Was Mr. Benson equally ready ?
On this being interpreted to him -- for he did not speak Pantouflian -- Benson grew pale with horror , but fell back on the proclamation .
He had brought the horns and tail , and so he must have the perquisites , and the Lady Molinda !
The king's mind was so much confused by this time , that he determined to leave it to the Lady Molinda herself .
`` Which of them will you have , my dear ? ''
he asked , in a kind voice .
But poor Molinda merely cried .
Then his majesty was almost driven to say that he would give the reward to whoever produced the hoofs by that day week .
But no sooner had he said this than the prince brought them out of his wallet , and displayed them in open Court .
This ended the case ; and Benson , after being entertained with sherry and sandwiches in the steward's room , was sent back to his master , And I regret to say that his temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself .
On the contrary , he was unusually cross and disagreeable for several days ; but we must , perhaps , make some allowance for his disappointment .
But if Benson was irritated , and suffered from the remarks of his fellow-servants , I do not think we can envy Prince Prigio .
Here he was , restored to his position indeed , but by no means to the royal favour .
For the king disliked him as much as ever , and was as angry as ever about the deaths of Enrico and Alphonso .
Nay , he was even more angry ; and , perhaps , not without reason .
He called up Prigio before the whole Court , and thereon the courtiers cheered like anything , but the king cried : `` Silence !
McDougal , drag the first man that shouts to the serpent-house in the zoological gardens , and lock him up with the rattlesnakes ! ''
After that the courtiers were very quiet .
`` Prince , '' said the king , as Prigio bowed before the throne , `` you are restored to your position , because I can not break my promise .
But your base and malevolent nature is even more conspicuously manifest in your selfish success than in your previous dastardly contempt of duty .
Why , confound you ! ''
cried the king , dropping the high style in which he had been speaking , and becoming the father , not the monarch , -- `` why , if you could kill the Firedrake , did you let your poor little brothers go and be b -- b -- b -- broiled ?
Eh !
what do you say , you sneak ?
` You didn't believe there were any Firedrakes ? '
That just comes of your eternal conceit and arrogance !
If you were clever enough to kill the creature -- and I admit that -- you were clever enough to know that what everybody said must be true .
` You have not generally found it so ? '
Well , you have this time , and let it be a lesson to you ; not that there is much comfort in that , for it is not likely you will ever have such another chance '' -- exactly the idea that had occurred to Benson .
Here the king wept , among the tears of the lord chief justice , the poet laureate , who had been awfully frightened when he heard of the rattlesnakes , the maids of honour , the chaplain royal , and everyone but Colonel McDougal , a Scottish soldier of fortune , who maintained a military reserve .
When his majesty had recovered , he said to Prigio , who had not been crying , he was too much absorbed , : `` A king's word is his bond .
Bring me a pen , somebody , and my cheque-book . ''
The royal cheque-book , bound in red morocco , was brought in by eight pages , with ink and a pen .
His majesty then filled up and signed the following satisfactory document -- , Ah !
my children , how I wish Mr. Arrowsmith would do as much for me ! ,
`` There ! ''
said his majesty , crossing his cheque and throwing sand over it , for blotting-paper had not yet been invented ; `` there , take that , and be off with you ! ''
Prince Prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal command , for he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as soon as possible , when his majesty yelled : `` Hi !
here !
come back !
I forgot something ; you've got to marry Molinda ! ''
THE prince had gone some way , when the king called after him .
How he wished he had the seven-league boots on , or that he had the cap of darkness in his pocket !
If he had been so lucky , he would now have got back to Gluckstein , and crossed the border with Lady Rosalind .
A million of money may not seem much , but a pair of young people who really love each other could live happily on less than the cheque he had in his pocket .
However , the king shouted very loud , as he always did when he meant to be obeyed , and the prince sauntered slowly back again .
`` Prigio ! ''
said his majesty , `` where were you off to ?
Don't you remember that this is your wedding-day ?
My proclamation offered , not only the money , which you have , but the hand of the Lady Molinda , which the Court chaplain will presently make your own .
I congratulate you , sir ; Molinda is a dear girl . ''
`` I have the highest affection and esteem for my cousin , sir , '' said the prince , `` but : -- '' `` I'll never marry him ! ''
cried poor Molinda , kneeling at the throne , where her streaming eyes and hair made a pretty and touching picture .
`` Never !
I despise him ! ''
`` I was about to say , sir , '' the prince went on , `` that I can not possibly have the pleasure of wedding my cousin . ''
`` The family gibbet , I presume , is in good working order ? ''
asked the king of the family executioner , a tall gaunt man in black and scarlet , who was only employed in the case of members of the blood royal .
`` Never better , sire , '' said the man , bowing with more courtliness than his profession indicated .
`` Very well , '' said the king ; `` Prince Prigio , you have your choice .
There is the gallows , here is Lady Molinda .
My duty is painful , but clear .
A king's word can not be broken .
Molly , or the gibbet ! ''
The prince bowed respectfully to Lady Molinda : `` Madam , my cousin , '' said he , `` your clemency will excuse my answer , and you will not misinterpret the apparent discourtesy of my conduct .
I am compelled , most unwillingly , to slight your charms , and to select the Extreme Rigour of the Law .
Executioner , lead on !
Do your duty ; for me , Prigio est prêt ; '' -- for this was his motto , and meant that he was ready .
Poor Lady Molinda could not but be hurt by the prince's preference for death over marriage to her , little as she liked him .
`` Is life , then , so worthless ?
and is Molinda so terrible a person that you prefer those arms , '' and she pointed to the gibbet , `` to these ?
'' -- here she held out her own , which were very white , round and pretty ; for Molinda was a good-hearted girl , she could not bear to see Prigio put to death ; and then , perhaps , she reflected that there are worse positions than the queenship of Pantouflia .
For Alphonso was gone -- crying would not bring him back .
`` Ah , Madam ! ''
said the prince , `` you are forgiving -- '' `` For you are brave ! ''
said Molinda , feeling : quite a respect for him .
`` But neither your heart nor mine is ours to give .
Since mine was another's , I understand too well the feeling of yours !
Do not let us buy life at the price of happiness and honour . ''
Then , turning to the king the prince said : `` Sir , is there no way but by death or marriage ?
You say you can not keep half only of your promise ; and that , if I accept the reward , I must also unite myself with my unwilling cousin .
Can not the whole proclamation be annulled , and will you consider the bargain void if I tear up this flimsy scroll ? ''
And here the prince fluttered the cheque for # 1,000,000 in the air .
For a moment the king was tempted ; but then he said to himself : `` Never mind , it's only an extra penny on the income-tax . ''
Then , `` Keep your dross , '' he shouted , meaning the million ; `` but let me keep my promise .
To chapel at once , or -- '' and he pointed to the executioner .
`` The word of a king of Pantouflia is sacred . ''
`` And so is that of a crown prince , '' answered Prigio ; `` and mine is pledged to a lady . ''
`` She shall be a mourning bride , '' cried the king savagely , `` unless '' -- here he paused for a moment -- `` unless you bring me back Alphohso and Enrico , safe and well ! ''
The prince thought for the space of a flash of lightning .
`` I accept the alternative , '' he said , `` if your majesty will grant me my conditions . ''
`` Name them ! ''
said the king .
`` Let me be transported to Gluckstein , left there unguarded , and if , in three days , I do not return with my brothers safe and well , your majesty shall be spared a cruel duty .
Prigio of Pantouflia will perish by his own hand . ''
The king , whose mind did not work very quickly , took some minutes to think over it .
Then he saw that by granting the prince's conditions , he would either recover his dear sons , or , at least , get rid of Prigio , without the unpleasantness of having him executed .
For , though some kings have put their eldest sons to death , and most have wished to do so , they have never been better loved by the people for their Roman virtue .
`` Honour bright ? ''
said the king at last .
`` Honour bright ! ''
answered the prince , and for the first time in many months , the royal father and son shook hands .
`` For you , madam , '' said Prigio in a stately way to Lady Molinda , `` in less than a week I trust we shall be taking our vows at the same altar , and that the close of the ceremony which finds us cousins will leave us brother and sister . ''
Poor Molinda merely stared ; for she could not imagine what he meant .
In a moment he was gone ; and having taken , by the king's permission , the flying carpet , he was back at the ambassador's house in Gluckstein .
WHO was glad to see the prince , if it was not Lady Rosalind ?
The white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment , and then back to white again , they were so alarmed at the change .
So the two went into the gardens together , and talked about a number of things ; but at last the prince told her that , before three days were over , all would be well , or all would be over with him .
For either he would have brought his brothers back , sound and well , to Falkenstein , or he would not survive his dishonour .
`` It is no more than right , '' he said ; `` for had I gone first , neither of them would have been sent to meet the monster after I had fallen .
And I should have fallen , dear Rosalind , if I had faced the Firedrake before I knew you .
'' Then when she asked him why , and what good she had done him , he told her all the story ; and how , before he fell in love with her , he didn't believe in fairies , or Firedrakes , or caps of darkness , or anything nice and impossible , but only in horrid useless facts , and chemistry , and geology , and arithmetic , and mathematics , and even political economy .
And the Firedrake would have made a mouthful of him , then .
So she was delighted when she heard this , almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most difficult adventure .
For it was one thing to egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake , and quite another to find the princes if they were alive , and restore them if they were dead !
But the prince said he had his plan , and he stayed that night at the ambassador's .
Next morning he rose very early , before anyone else was up , that he might not have to say `` Good-bye '' to Lady Rosalind .
Then he flew in a moment to the old lonely castle , where nobody went for fear of ghosts , ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein .
How still it was , how deserted ; not a sign of life , and yet the prince was looking everywhere for some living thing .
He hunted the castle through in vain , and then went out to the stable-yard ; but all the dogs , of course , had been taken away , and the farmers had offered homes to the poultry .
At last , stretched at full length in a sunny place , the prince found a very old , half-blind , miserable cat .
The poor creature was lean , and its fur had fallen off in patches ; it could no longer catch birds , nor even mice , and there was nobody to give it milk .
But cats do not look far into the future ; and this old black cat -- Frank was his name -- had got a breakfast somehow , and was happy in the sun .
The prince stood and looked at him pityingly , and he thought that even a sick old cat was , in some ways , happier than most men .
`` Well , '' said the prince at last , `` he could not live long anyway , and it must be done .
He will feel nothing . ''
Then he drew the sword of sharpness , and with one turn of his wrist cut the cat's head clean off .
It did not at once change into a beautiful young lady , as perhaps you expect ; no , that was improbable , and , as the prince was in love already , would have been vastly inconvenient .
The dead cat lay there , like any common cat .
Then the prince built up a heap of straw , with wood on it ; and there he laid poor puss , and set fire to the pile .
Very soon there was nothing of old black Frank left but ashes !
Then the prince ran upstairs to the fairy cupboard , his heart beating loudly with excitement , The sun was shining through the arrow-shot window ; all the yellow motes were dancing in its rays .
The light fell on the strange heaps of fairy things -- talismans and spells .
The prince hunted about here and there , and at last he discovered six ancient water-vessels of black leather , each with a silver plate on it , and on the plate letters engraved .
This was what was written on the plates : AQVA .
DE .
FONTE .
LEONVM .
* * Water from the Fountain of Lions .
`` Thank heaven ! ''
said the prince .
`` I thought they were sure to have brought it ! ''
Then he took one of the old black-leather bottles , and ran downstairs again to the place where he had burned the body of the poor old sick cat .
He opened the bottle , and poured a few drops of the water on the ashes and the dying embers .
Up there sprang a tall , white flame of fire , waving like a tongue of light ; and forth from the heap jumped the most beautiful , strong , funny , black cat that ever was seen !
It was Frank as he had been in the vigour of his youth ; and he knew the prince at once , and rubbed himself against him and purred .
The prince lifted up Frank and kissed his nose for joy ; and a bright tear rolled down on Frank's face , and made him rub his nose with his paw in the most comical manner .
Then the prince set him down , and he ran round and round after his tail ; and , lastly , cocked his tail up , and marched proudly after the prince into the castle .
`` Oh , Frank ! ''
said Prince Prigio , `` no cat since the time of Puss in Boots was ever so well taken care of as you shall be .
For if the fairy water from the Fountain of Lions can bring you back to life -- why , there is a chance for Alphonso and Enrico ! ''
Then Prigio bustled about , got ready some cold luncheon from the store-room , took all his fairy things that he was likely to need , sat down with them on the flying carpet , and wished himself at the mountain of the Firedrake .
`` I have the king now , '' he said ; `` for if I can't find the ashes of my brothers , by Jove !
I'll !
-- '' Do you know what he meant to do , if he could not find his brothers ?
Let every child-guess .
Off he flew ; and there he was in a second , just beside poor Alphonso's garden-engine .
Then Prigio , seeing a little heap of grey ashes beside the engine , watered them with the fairy water ; and up jumped Alphonso , as jolly as ever , his sword in his hand .
`` Hullo , Prigio ! ''
cried he ; `` are you come after the monster too ?
I've been asleep , and I had a kind of dream that he beat me .
But the pair of us will tackle him .
How is Molinda ? ''
`` Prettier than ever , '' said Prigio ; `` but anxious about you .
However , the Firedrake's dead and done for ; so never mind him .
But I left Enrico somewhere about .
Just you sit down and wait a minute , till I fetch him . ''
The prince said this , because he did not wish Alphonso to know that he and Enrico had not had quite the best of it in the affair with the monster .
`` All right , old fellow , '' says Alphonso ; `` but have you any luncheon with you ?
Never was so hungry in my life ! ''
Prince Prigio had thought of this , and he brought out some cold sausage , to which Alphonso was partial , and some bread , with which the younger prince expressed himself satisfied .
Then Prigio went up the hill some way , first warning Alphonso not to sit on his carpet for fear of accidents like that which happened to Benson .
In a hollow of the hill , sure enough there was the sword of Enrico , the diamonds of the hilt gleaming in the sun .
And there was a little heap of grey ashes .
The prince poured a few drops of the water from the Fountain of Lions on them , and up , of course , jumped Enrico , just as Alphonso had done .
`` Sleepy old chap you are , Enrico , '' said the prince ; `` but come on , Alphonso will have finished the grub unless we look smart . ''
So back they came , in time to get their share of what was going ; and they drank the Remora's very good health , when Prigio told them about the fight .
But neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for ; because Prigio invented a story that the mountain was enchanted , and that , as long as the Firedrake lived , everyone who came there fell asleep .
He did tell them about the flying carpet , however , which of course did not much surprise them , because they had read all about it in the Arabian Nights and other historical works .
`` And now I'll show you fun ! ''
said Prigio ; and he asked them both to take their seats on the carpet , and wished to be in the valley of the Remora .
There they were in a moment , among the old knights whom , if you remember , the Remora had frozen into stone .
There was quite a troop of them , in all sorts of armour -- Greek and Roman , and Knight Templars like Front ' de Bouf and Brian du Bois Gilbert -- all the brave warriors that had tried to fight the Remora since the world began .
Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps , and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight .
And as they did it , lo and behold !
each knight came alive , with his horse , and lifted his sword and shoute : `` Long live Prince Prigio ! ''
in Greek , Latin , Egyptian , French , German , and Spanish , -- all of which the prince perfectly understood , and spoke like a native .
So he marshalled them in order , and sent them off to ride to Falkenstein and cry : `` Prince Prigio is coming ! ''
Off they went , the horses ' hoofs clattering , banners flying , sunshine glittering on the spear-points .
Off they rode to Falkenstein ; and when the king saw them come galloping in , I can tell you he had no more notion of hanging Prigio .
THE princes returned to Gluckstein on the carpet , and went to the best inn , where they dined together and slept .
Next morning they , and the ambassador , who had been told all the story , and Lady Rosalind , floated comfortably on the carpet , back to Falkenstein , where the king wept like anything on the shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico .
They could not make out why he cried so , nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried ; but soon they were all laughing and happy again .
But then -- would you believe he could be so mean ?
-- he refused to keep his royal promise , and restore Prigio to his crown-princeship !
Kings are like that .
But Prigio , very quietly asking for the head of the Firedrake , said he 'd pour the magic water on that , and bring the Firedrake back to life again , unless his majesty behaved rightly .
This threat properly frightened King Grognio , and he apologised .
Then the king shook hands with Prigio in public , and thanked him , and said he was proud of him .
As to Lady Rosalind , the old gentleman quite fell in love with her , and he sent at once to the Chaplain Royal to get into his surplice , and marry all the young people off at once , without waiting for wedding-cakes , and milliners , and all the rest of it .
Now , just as they were forming a procession to march into church , who should appear but the queen !
Her majesty had been travelling by post all the time , and , luckily , had heard of none of the doings since Prigio , Benson , and the king left Gluckstein .
I say luckily because if she had heard of them , she would not have believed a word of them .
But when she saw Alphonso and Enrico , she was much pleased , and said : `` Naughty boys !
Where have you been hiding ?
The king had some absurd story about your having been killed by a fabulous monster .
Bah !
don't tell me .
I always said you would come back after a little trip -- didn't I , Prigio ? ''
`` Certainly , madam , '' said Prigio ; `` and I said so , too .
Didn't I say so ? ''
And all the courtiers cried : `` Yes , you did ; '' but some added , to themselves , `` He always says , ` Didn't I say so ? ' ''
Then the queen was introduced to Lady Rosalind , and she said it was `` rather a short engagement , but she supposed young people understood their own affairs best . ''
And they do !
So the three pairs were married , with the utmost rejoicings ; and her majesty never , her whole life long , could be got to believe that anything unusual had occurred .
The honeymoon of Prince Prigio and the Crown Princess Rosalind was passed at the castle , where the prince had been deserted by the Court .
But now it was delightfully fitted up ; and Master Frank marched about the house with his tail in the air , as if the place belonged to him .
Now , on the second day of their honeymoon , the prince and princess were sitting in the garden together , and the prince said , `` Are you quite happy , my dear ? ''
and Rosalind said , `` Yes ; quite . ''
But the prince did not like the tone of her voice , and he said : `` No , there's something ; do tell me what it is . ''
`` Well , '' said Rosalind , putting her head on his shoulder , and speaking very low , `` I want everybody to love you as much as I do .
No , not quite so very much , -- but I want them to like you .
Now they can't , because they are afraid of you ; for you are so awfully clever .
Now , couldn't you take the wishing cap , and wish to be no cleverer than other people ?
Then everybody would like you ! ''
The prince thought a minute , then he said : `` Your will is law , my dear ; anything to please you .
Just wait a minute ! ''
Then he ran upstairs , for the last time , to the fairy garret , and he put on the wishing cap .
`` No , '' thought he to himself , `` I won't wish that .
Every man has one secret from his wife , and this shall be mine . ''
Then he said aloud : `` I wish to SEEM no CLEVERER THAN OTHER PEOPLE . ''
Then he ran downstairs again , and the princess noticed a great difference in him , though , of course , there was really none at all , and so did everyone .
For the prince remained as clever as ever he had been ; but , as nobody observed it , he became the most popular prince , and finally the best-beloved king who had ever sat on the throne of Pantouflia .
But occasionally Rosalind would say , `` I do believe , my dear , that you are really as clever as ever ! ''
And he was !

I 'm sure I don't know what to do with that boy ! ''
said King Prigio of Pantouflia .
`` If you don't know , my dear , '' said Queen Rosalind , his illustrious consort , `` I can't see what is to be done .
You are so clever . ''
The king and queen were sitting in the royal library , of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages , all equally familiar to King Prigio .
The queen could not read most of them herself , but the king used to read them aloud to her .
A good many years had passed -- seventeen , in fact -- since Queen Rosalind was married , but you would not think it to look at her .
Her grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful , her dark hair as dark , and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing , as on the day when she was a bride .
And she was as fond of the king as when he was only Prince Prigio , and he was as fond of her as on the night when he first met her at the ball .
`` No , I don't know what to do with Dick , '' said the king .
He meant his son , Prince Ricardo , but he called him Dick in private .
`` I believe it's the fault of his education , '' his Majesty went on .
`` We have not brought him up rightly .
These fairy books are at the bottom of his provoking behaviour , '' and he glanced round the shelves .
`` Now , when I was a boy , my dear mother tried to prevent me from reading fairy books , because she did not believe in fairies . ''
`` But she was wrong , you know , '' said the queen .
`` Why , if it had not been for all these fairy presents , the Cap of Darkness and all the rest of them , you never could have killed the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast , and -- you never could have married me , '' the queen added , in a happy whisper , blushing beautifully , for that was a foolish habit of hers .
`` It is quite true , '' said the king , `` and therefore I thought it best to bring Dick up on fairy books , that he might know what is right , and have no nonsense about him .
But perhaps the thing has been overdone ; at all events , it is not a success .
I wonder if fathers and sons will ever understand each other , and get on well together ?
There was my poor father , King Grognio , he wanted me to take to adventures , like other princes , fighting Firedrakes , and so forth ; and I did not care for it , till you set me on , '' and he looked very kindly at her Majesty .
`` And now , here's Dick , '' the monarch continued , `` I can't hold him back .
He is always after a giant , or a dragon , or a magician , as the case may be ; he will certainly be ploughed for his examination at College .
Never opens a book .
What does he care , off after every adventure he can hear about ?
An idle , restless youth !
Ah , my poor country , when I am gone , what may not be your misfortunes under Ricardo ! ''
Here his Majesty sighed , and seemed plunged in thought .
`` But you are not going yet , my dear , '' said the queen .
`` Why you are not forty !
And young people will be young people .
You were quite proud when poor Dick came home with his first brace of gigantic fierce birds , killed off his own sword , and with such a pretty princess he had rescued -- dear Jaqueline ?
I 'm sure she is like a daughter to me .
I can not do without her . ''
`` I wish she were a daughter-in-law ; I wish Dick would take a fancy to marry her , '' said the king .
`` A nicer girl I never saw . ''
`` And so accomplished , '' added Queen Rosalind .
`` That girl can turn herself into anything -- a mouse , a fly , a lion , a wheelbarrow , a church !
I never knew such talent for magic .
Of course she had the best of teachers , the Fairy Paribanou herself ; but very few girls , in our time , devote so many hours to practice as dear Jaqueline .
Even now , when she is out of the schoolroom , she still practises her scales .
I saw her turning little Dollie into a fish and back again in the bath-room last night .
The child was delighted . ''
In these times , you must know , princesses learned magic , just as they learn the piano nowadays ; but they had their music lessons too , dancing , calisthenics , and the use of the globes .
`` Yes , she's a dear , good girl , '' said the king ; `` yet she looks melancholy .
I believe , myself , that if Ricardo asked her to marry him , she would not say ` No . '
But that's just one of the things I object to most in Dick .
Round the world he goes , rescuing ladies from every kind of horror -- from dragons , giants , cannibals , magicians ; and then , when a girl naturally expects to be married to him , as is usual , off he rides !
He has no more heart than a flounder .
Why , at his age I -- '' `` At his age , my dear , you were so hard-hearted that you were quite a proverb .
Why , I have been told that you used to ask girls dreadful puzzling questions , like ` Who was Caesar Borgia ? '
` What do you know of Edwin and Morcar ? '
and so on . ''
`` I had not seen you then , '' said the king .
`` And Ricardo has not seen her , whoever she may be .
Besides , he can't possibly marry all of them .
And I think a girl should consider herself lucky if she is saved from a dragon or a giant , without expecting to be married next day . ''
`` Perhaps ; but it is usual , '' said the king , `` and their families expect it , and keep sending ambassadors to know what Dick's intentions are .
I would not mind it all so very much if he killed the monsters off his own sword , as he did that first brace , in fair fight .
But ever since he found his way into that closet where the fairy presents lie , everything has been made too easy for him .
It is a royal road to glory , or giant-slaying made easy .
In his Cap of Darkness a poor brute of a dragon can't see him .
In his Shoes of Swiftness the giants can't catch him .
His Sword of Sharpness would cut any oak asunder at a blow ! ''
`` But you were very glad of them when you made the Ice-beast and the Fire - beast fight and kill each other , '' said the queen .
`` Yes , my dear ; but it wanted some wit , if I may say so , to do that , and Dick just goes at it hammer and tongs : anybody could do it .
It's intellect I miss in Ricardo .
How am I to know whether he could make a good fight for it without all these fairy things ?
I wonder what the young rogue is about to-day ?
He'll be late for dinner , as usual , I daresay .
I can't stand want of punctuality at meals , '' remarked his Majesty , which is a sign that he was growing old after all ; for where is the fun of being expected always to come home in time for dinner when , perhaps , you are fishing , and the trout are rising splendidly ?
`` Young people will be young people , '' said the queen .
`` If you are anxious about him , why don't you look for him in the magic crystal ? ''
Now the magic crystal was a fairy present , a great ball of glass in which , if you looked , you saw the person you wanted to see , and what he was doing , however far away he might be , if he was on the earth at all .
`` I'll just take a look at it , '' said the king ; `` it only wants three-quarters of an hour to dinner-time . ''
His Majesty rose , and walked to the crystal globe , which was in a stand , like other globes .
He stared into it , he turned it round and round , and Queen Rosalind saw him grow quite pale as he gazed .
`` I don't see him anywhere , '' said the king , `` and I have looked everywhere .
I do hope nothing has happened to the boy .
He is so careless .
If he dropped his Cap of Darkness in a fight with a giant , why who knows what might occur ? ''
`` Oh , ` Gio , how you frighten me ! ''
said the queen .
King Prigio was still turning the crystal globe .
`` Stop ! ''
he cried ; `` I see a beautiful princess , fastened by iron chains to a rock beside the sea , in a lonely place .
They must have fixed her up as a sacrifice to a sea-monster , like what's - her-name . ''
This proves how anxious he was , or , being so clever and learned , he would have remembered that her name was Andromeda .
`` I bet Dick is not far off , where there is an adventure on hand .
But where on earth can he be ?
... My word ! ''
suddenly exclaimed the monarch , in obvious excitement .
`` What is it , dear ? ''
cried the queen , with all the anxiety of a mother .
`` Why , the sea where the girl is , has turned all red as blood ! ''
exclaimed the king .
`` Now it is all being churned up by the tail of a tremendous monster .
He is a whopper !
He's coming on shore ; the girl is fainting .
He's out on shore !
He is extremely poorly , blood rushing from his open jaws .
He's dying !
And , hooray !
here's Dick coming out of his enormous mouth , all in armour set with sharp spikes , and a sword in his hand .
He's covered with blood , but he's well and hearty .
He must have been swallowed by the brute , and cut him up inside .
Now he's cutting the beast's head off .
Now he's gone to the princess ; a very neat bow he has made her .
Dick's manners are positively improving !
Now he's cutting her iron chains off with the Sword of Sharpness .
And now he's made her another bow , and he's actually taking leave of her .
Poor thing !
How disappointed she is looking .
And she's so pretty , too .
I say , Rosalind , shall I shout to him through the magic horn , and tell him to bring her home here , on the magic carpet ? ''
`` I think not , dear ; the palace is quite full , '' said the queen .
But the real reason was that she wanted Ricardo to marry her favourite Princess Jaqueline , and she did not wish the new princess to come in the way .
`` As you like , '' said the king , who knew what was in her mind very well .
`` Besides , I see her own people coming for her .
I 'm sorry for her , but it can't be helped , and Dick is half-way home by now on the Shoes of Swiftness .
I daresay he will not keep dinner waiting after all .
But what a fright the boy has given me ! ''
At this moment a whirring in the air and a joyous shout were heard .
It was Prince Ricardo flying home on his Seven-league Boots .
`` Hi , Ross ! ''
he shouted , `` just weigh this beast's head .
I've had a splendid day with a sea-monster .
Get the head stuffed , will you ?
We'll have it set up in the billiard-room . ''
`` Yes , Master Dick -- I mean your Royal Highness , '' said Ross , a Highland keeper , who had not previously been employed by a Reigning Family .
`` It's a fine head , whatever , '' he added , meditatively .
Prince Ricardo now came beneath the library window , and gave his parents a brief account of his adventure .
`` I picked the monster up early in the morning , '' he said , `` through the magic telescope , father . ''
`` What country was he in ? ''
said the king .
`` The country people whom I met called it Ethiopia .
They were niggers . ''
`` And in what part of the globe is Ethiopia , Ricardo ? ''
`` Oh !
I don't know .
Asia , perhaps , '' answered the prince .
The king groaned .
`` That boy will never understand our foreign relations .
Ethiopia in Asia ! ''
he said to himself , but he did not choose to make any remark at the moment .
The prince ran upstairs to dress .
On the stairs he met the Princess Jaqueline .
`` Oh , Dick !
are you hurt ? ''
she said , turning very pale .
`` No , not I ; but the monster is .
I had a capital day , Jack ; rescued a princess , too . ''
`` Was she -- was she very pretty , Dick ? ''
`` Oh !
I don't know .
Pretty enough , I daresay .
Much like other girls .
Why , you look quite white !
What's the matter ?
Now you look all right again ; '' for , indeed , the Princess Jaqueline was blushing .
`` I must dress .
I 'm ever so late , '' he said , hurrying upstairs ; and the princess , with a little sigh , went down to the royal drawing-room .
When dinner was over and the ladies had left the room , the king tried to speak seriously to Prince Ricardo .
This was a thing which he disliked doing very much .
`` There's very little use in preaching , '' his Majesty used to say , `` to a man , or rather a boy , of another generation .
My taste was for books ; I only took to adventures because I was obliged to do it .
Dick's taste is for adventures ; I only wish some accident would make him take to books .
But everyone must get his experience for himself ; and when he has got it , he is lucky if it is not too late .
I wish I could see him in love with some nice girl , who would keep him at home . ''
The king did not expect much from talking seriously to Dick .
However , he began by asking questions about the day's sport , which Ricardo answered with modesty .
Then his Majesty observed that , from all he had ever read or heard , he believed Ethiopia , where the fight was , to be in Africa , not in Asia .
`` I really wish , Ricardo , that you would attend to your geography a little more .
It is most necessary to a soldier that he should know where his enemy is , and if he has to fight the Dutch , for instance , not to start with his army for Central Asia . ''
`` I could always spot them through the magic glass , father , '' said Dick ; `` it saves such a lot of trouble .
I hate geography . ''
`` But the glass might be lost or broken , or the Fairies might take it away , and then where are you ? ''
`` Oh , you would know where to go , or Mr. Belsham . ''
Now Mr. Belsham was his tutor , from Oxford .
`` But I shall not always be here , and when I die -- '' `` Don't talk of dying , sire , '' said Dick .
`` Why , you are not so very old ; you may live for years yet .
Besides , I can't stand the notion .
You must live for ever ! ''
`` That sentiment is unusual in a Crown Prince , '' thought the king ; but he was pleased for all that .
`` Well , to oblige you , I'll try to struggle against old age , '' he said ; `` but there are always accidents .
Now , Dick , like a good fellow , and to please me , work hard all to-morrow till the afternoon .
I'll come in and help you .
And there's always a splendid evening rise of trout in the lake just now , so you can have your play after your work .
You'll enjoy it more , and I daresay you are tired after a long day with the big game .
It used to tire me , I remember . ''
`` I am rather tired , '' said Dick ; and indeed he looked a little pale , for a day in the inside of a gigantic sea-monster is fatiguing , from the heat and want of fresh air which are usually found in such places .
`` I think I'll turn in ; goodnight , my dear old governor , '' he said , in an affectionate manner , though he was not usually given to many words .
Then he went and kissed his mother and the Princess Jaqueline , whom he engaged to row him on the lake next evening , while he fished .
`` And don't you go muffing them with the landing-net , Jack , as you generally do , '' said his Royal Highness , as he lit his bedroom candle .
`` I wish he would not call me Jack , '' said the princess to the queen .
`` It's better than Lina , my dear , '' said her Majesty , who in late life had become fond of her little joke ; `` that always sounds as if someone else was fatter , -- and I hope there is not someone else . ''
The princess was silent , and fixed her eyes on her book .
Presently the king came in , and played a game with Lina at picquet .
When they were all going to bed , he said : `` Just come into the study , Lina .
I want you to write a few letters for me . ''
The princess followed him and took her seat at the writing table .
The letters were very short .
One was to Herr Schnipp , tailor to the king and royal family ; another was to the royal swordmaker , another to the bootmaker , another to the optician , another to the tradesman who supplied the august family with carpets and rugs , another to his Majesty's hatter .
They were all summoned to be at the palace early next morning .
Then his Majesty yawned , apologised , and went to bed .
The princess also went to her room , or bower as it was then called , but not to sleep .
She was unhappy that Dick did not satisfy his father , and that he was so careless , and also about other things .
`` And why does the king want all these tailors and hatters so suddenly , telescope-makers and swordmakers and shoemakers , too ? ''
she asked herself , as she stood at the window watching the moon .
`` I could find out .
I could turn myself into a dog or a cat , and go into the room where he is giving his orders .
But that is awkward , for when the servants see Rip '' , that was the dog , `` in two places at once , they begin to think the palace is haunted , and it makes people talk .
Besides , I know it is wrong to listen to what one is not meant to hear .
It is often difficult to be a magician and a good girl .
The temptations are so strong , stronger than most people allow for . ''
So she remained , with the moon shining on her pretty yellow hair and her white dress , wondering what the king intended to do , and whether it was something that Dick would not like .
`` How stupid of me , '' she said at length , `` after all the lessons I have had .
Why , I can drink the moon ! ''
Now , this is a way of knowing what anyone else is thinking of and intends to do , for the moon sees and knows everything .
Whether it is quite fair is another matter ; but , at all events , it is not listening .
And anyone may see that , if you are a magician , like the Princess Jaqueline , a great many difficult questions as to what is right and wrong at once occur which do not trouble other people .
King Prigio's secret , why he sent for the tailor and the other people , was his own secret .
The princess decided that she would not find it out by turning herself into Rip or the cat , whose name was Semiramis , and , so far , she was quite right .
But she was very young , and it never occurred to her that it was just as wrong to find out what the king meant by drinking the moon as by listening in disguise .
As she grew older she learned to know better ; but this is just the danger of teaching young girls magic , and for that very reason it has been given up in most countries .
However , the princess did not think about right and wrong , unluckily .
She went to the bookcase and took down her Cornelius Agrippa , in one great tall black volume , with silver clasps which nobody else could open ; for , as the princess said , there are books which it would never do to leave lying about where the servants or anybody could read them .
Nobody could undo the clasps , however strong or clever he might be ; but the princess just breathed on them and made a sign , and the book flew open at the right place -- Book IV. , chapter vi. , about the middle of page 576 .
The magic spell was in Latin , of course ; but the princess knew Latin very well , and soon she had the magic song by heart .
Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf .
Then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains , and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame , opposite the window .
And into that mirror the moon shone white and full , filling all the space of it , so that the room was steeped in a strange silver light .
Now the whole room seemed to sway gently , waving and trembling ; and as it trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music , as if it were filled with the waves of the sea .
Then the princess took a great silver basin , covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver .
She poured water into the basin , and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the Latin book .
It was something like this , in English : `` Oh Lady Moon , on the waters riding , On shining waters , in silver sheen , Show me the secret the heart is hiding , Show me the truth of the thought , oh Queen !
`` Oh waters white , where the moon is riding , That knows what shall be and what has been , Tell me the secret the heart is hiding , Wash me the truth of it , clear and clean ! ''
As she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled , and then fell still again ; and the princess knelt in the middle of the room , and the moon and the white light from the mirror of the moon fell in the water .
Then the princess raised the basin , and stooped her mouth to it and drank the water , spilling a few drops , and so she drank the moon and the knowledge of the moon .
Then the moon was darkened without a cloud , and there was darkness in the sky for a time , and all the dogs in the world began to howl .
When the moon shone again , the princess rose and put out the two white lights , and drew the curtains ; and presently she went to bed .
`` Now I know all about it , '' she said .
`` It is clever ; everything the king does is clever , and he is so kind that I daresay he does not mean any harm .
But it seems a cruel trick to play on poor Ricardo .
However , Jaqueline is on the watch , and I'll show them a girl can do more than people think , '' -- as , indeed , she could .
After meditating in this way , the princess fell sleep , and did not waken till her maid came to call her .
`` Oh !
your Royal Highness , what's this on the floor ? ''
said the faithful Rosina , as she was arranging the princess's things for her to get up .
`` Why , what is it ? ''
asked the princess .
`` Ever so many -- four , five , six , seven -- little shining drops of silver lying on the carpet , as if they had melted and fallen there ! ''
`` They have not hurt the carpet ? ''
said the princess .
`` Oh dear !
the queen won't be pleased at all .
It was a little chemical experiment I was trying last night . ''
But she knew very well that she must have dropped seven drops of the enchanted water .
`` No , your Royal Highness , the carpet is not harmed , '' said Rosina ; `` only your Royal Highness should do these things in the laboratory .
Her Majesty has often spoke about it . ''
`` You are quite right , '' said the princess ; `` but as there is no harm done , we'll say nothing about it this time .
And , Rosina , you may keep the silver drops for yourself . ''
`` Your Royal Highness is always very kind , '' said Rosina , which was true ; but how much better and wiser it is not to begin to deceive !
We never know how far we may be carried , and so Jaqueline found out .
For when she went down to breakfast , there was the king in a great state of excitement , for him .
`` It's most extraordinary , '' said his Majesty .
`` What is ? ''
asked the queen .
`` Why , didn't you notice it ?
No , you had gone to bed before it happened .
But I was taking a walk in the moonlight , on the balcony , and I observed it carefully . ''
`` Observed what , my dear ? ''
asked the queen , who was pouring out the tea .
`` Didn't you see it , Dick ?
Late as usual , you young dog ! ''
the king remarked as Ricardo entered the room .
`` See what , sir ? ''
said Dick .
`` Oh , you were asleep hours before , now I think of it !
But it was the most extraordinary thing , an unpredicted eclipse of the moon !
You must have noticed it , Jaqueline ; you sat up later .
How the dogs howled ! ''
`` No ; I mean yes , '' murmured poor Jaqueline , who of course had caused the whole affair by her magic arts , but who had forgotten , in the excitement of the moment , that an eclipse of the moon , especially if entirely unexpected , is likely to attract very general attention .
Jaqueline could not bear to tell a fib , especially to a king who had been so kind to her ; besides , fibbing would not alter the facts .
`` Yes , I did see it , '' she admitted , blushing .
`` Had it not been predicted ? ''
`` Not a word about it whispered anywhere , '' said his Majesty .
`` I looked up the almanack at once .
It is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw , and I've seen a good many . ''
`` The astronomers must be duffers , '' said Prince Ricardo .
`` I never thought there was much in physical science of any sort ; most dreary stuff .
Why , they say the earth goes round the sun , whereas any fool can see it is just the other way on . ''
King Prigio was struck aghast by these sentiments in the mouth of his son and heir , the hope of Pantouflia .
But what was the king to say in reply ?
The astronomers of Pantouflia , who conceived that they knew a great deal , had certainly been taken by surprise this time .
Indeed , they have not yet satisfactorily explained this eclipse of the moon , though they have written volumes about it .
`` Why , it may be the sun next ! ''
exclaimed his Majesty .
`` Anything may happen .
The very laws of gravitation themselves may go askew ! ''
At this moment the butler , William , who had been in the queen's family when she was a girl , entered , and announced : `` Some of the royal tradesmen , by appointment , to see your Majesty . ''
So the king , who had scarcely eaten any breakfast , much to the annoyance of the queen , who was not agitated by eclipses , went out and joined the tailors and the rest of them .
Dick went on with his breakfast .
He ate cold pastry , and poached eggs , and ham , and rolls , and raspberry jam , and hot cakes ; and he drank two cups of coffee .
Meanwhile the king had joined the tradesmen who attended by his orders .
They were all met in the royal study , where the king made them a most splendid bow , and requested them to be seated .
But they declined to sit in his sacred presence , and the king observed that , in that case he must stand up .
`` I have invited you here , gentlemen , '' he said , `` on a matter of merely private importance , but I must request that you will be entirely silent as to the nature of your duties .
It is difficult , I know , not to talk about one's work , but in this instance I am sure you will oblige me . ''
`` Your Majesty has only to command , '' said Herr Schnipp .
`` There have been monarchs , in neighbouring kingdoms , who would have cut off all our heads after we had done a bit of secret business ; but the merest word of your Majesty is law to your loving subjects . ''
The other merchants murmured assent , for King Prigio was really liked by his people .
He was always good-tempered and polite .
He never went to war with anybody .
He spent most of the royal income on public objects , and of course there were scarcely any taxes to speak of .
Moreover , he had abolished what is called compulsory education , or making everybody go to school whether he likes it or not ; a most mischievous and tyrannical measure !
`` A fellow who can't teach himself to read , '' said the king , `` is not worth teaching . ''
For all these reasons , and because they were so fond of the queen , his subjects were ready to do anything in reason for King Prigio .
Only one tradesman , bowing very deep and blushing very much , said : `` Your Majesty , will you hear me for one moment ? ''
`` For an hour , with pleasure , Herr Schmidt , '' said the monarch .
`` It is an untradesman-like and an unusual thing to decline an order ; and if your Majesty asked for my heart's blood , I am ready to shed it , not to speak of anything in the line of my business -- namely , boot and shoe making .
But keep a secret from my wife , I fairly own to your Majesty that I can not . ''
Herr Schmidt went down on his knees and wept .
`` Rise , Herr Schmidt , '' said the king , taking him by the hand .
`` A more honourable and chivalrous confession of an amiable weakness , if it is to be called a weakness , I never heard .
Sir , you have been true to your honour and your prince , in face of what few men can bear , the chance of ridicule .
There is no one here , I hope , but respects and will keep the secret of Herr Schmidt's confession ? ''
The assembled shopkeepers could scarcely refrain from tears .
`` Long live King Prigio the Good ! ''
they exclaimed , and vowed that everything should be kept dark .
`` Indeed , sire , '' said the swordmaker , `` all the rest of us are bachelors . ''
`` That is none the worse for my purpose gentlemen , '' said his Majesty ; `` but I trust that you will not long deprive me of sons and subjects worthy to succeed to such fathers .
And now , if Herr Schmidt will kindly find his way to the buttery , where refreshments are ready , I shall have the pleasure of conducting you to the scene of your labours . ''
Thus speaking , the king , with another magnificent bow , led the way upstairs to a little turret-room , in a deserted part of the palace .
Bidding the tradesmen enter , he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things : an old cap or two , a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion , an old broadsword , a shabby old Persian rug , an ivory spy - glass , and other articles .
These were , in fact , the fairy presents , which had been given to the king at his christening , and by aid of which , and his natural acuteness , he had , in his youth , succeeded in many remarkable adventures .
The caps were the Wishing Cap and the Cap of Darkness .
The rug was the famous carpet which carried its owner through the air wherever he wished to go .
The sword was the Sword of Sharpness .
The ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to see , however far off .
The boots were the Seven-league Boots , which Hop-o ' - my-Thumb stole from the Ogre about 1697 .
There were other valuable objects , but these were the most useful and celebrated .
Of course the king did not tell the tradesmen what they were .
`` Now , gentlemen , '' said his Majesty , `` you see these old things .
For reasons which I must ask you to excuse me for keeping to myself , I wish you to provide me with objects exactly and precisely similar to these , with all the look of age . ''
The tradesmen examined the objects , each choosing that in his own line of business .
`` As to the sword , sire , '' said the cutler , `` it is an Andrea Ferrara , a fine old blade .
By a lucky accident , I happen to have one at home in a small collection of ancient weapons , exactly like it .
This evening it shall be at your Majesty's disposal . ''
`` Perhaps , Herr Schnitzler , you will kindly write an order for it , as I wish no one of you to leave the palace , if you can conveniently stay , till your business is finished . ''
`` With pleasure , your Majesty , '' says the cutler .
`` As to the old rug , '' said the upholsterer , `` I have a Persian one quite identical with it at home , at your Majesty's service . ''
`` Then you can do like Herr Schnitzler , '' who was the cutler .
`` And I , '' said the hatter , `` have two old caps just like these , part of a bankrupt theatrical stock . ''
`` We are most fortunate , '' said the king .
`` The boots , now I come to think of it , are unimportant , at least for the present .
Perhaps we can borrow a pair from the theatre . ''
`` As for the glass , '' said the optician , `` if your Majesty will allow me to take it home with me -- '' `` I am afraid I can not part with it , '' said the king ; `` but that , too , is unimportant , or not very pressing . ''
Then he called for a servant , to order luncheon for the shopkeepers , and paper for them to write their orders on .
But no one was within hearing , and in that very old part of the palace there were no bells .
`` Just pardon me for an instant , while I run downstairs , '' said his Majesty ; `` and , it seems a strange thing to ask , but may I advise you not to sit down on that carpet ?
I have a reason for it . ''
In fact , he was afraid that someone might sit down on it , and wish he was somewhere else , and be carried away , as was the nature of the carpet .
King Prigio was not absent a minute , for he met William on the stairs ; but when he came back , there was not one single person in the turret-room !
`` Where on earth are they ? ''
cried the king , rushing through all the rooms in that part of the castle .
He shouted for them , and looked everywhere ; but there was not a trace of tailor , hatter , optician , swordmaker , upholsterer .
The king hastened to a window over the gate , and saw the sentinels on duty .
`` Hi ! ''
he called .
And the sentinels turned round , looked up , and saluted .
`` Have you seen anyone go out ? ''
he cried .
`` No one , sire , '' answered the soldiers .
The king , who began to guess what had happened , hurried back to the turret-room .
There were all the tradesmen with parcels under their arms .
`` What means this , gentlemen ? ''
said his Majesty , severely .
`` For what reason did you leave the room without my permission ? ''
They all knelt down , humbly imploring his compassion .
`` Get up , you donkeys ! ''
said the king , forgetting his politeness .
`` Get up , and tell me where you have been hiding yourselves . ''
The hatter came forward , and said : `` Sire , you will not believe me ; indeed , I can scarcely believe it myself ! ''
`` Nor none of us can't , '' said the swordmaker .
`` We have been home , and brought the articles .
All orders executed with punctuality and dispatch , '' he added , quoting his own advertisement without thinking of it .
On this the swordmaker took out and exhibited the Andrea Ferrara blade , which was exactly like the Sword of Sharpness .
The upholsterer undid his parcel , and there was a Persian rug , which no one could tell from the magical carpet .
The hatter was fumbling with the string of his parcel , when he suddenly remembered , what the king in his astonishment had not noticed , that he had a cap on himself .
He pulled it off in a hurry , and the king at once saw that it was his Wishing Cap , and understood all about the affair .
The hatter , in his absence , had tried on the Wishing Cap , and had wished that he himself and his friends were all at home and back again with their wares at the palace .
And what he wished happened , of course , as was natural .
In a moment the king saw how much talk this business would produce in the country , and he decided on the best way to stop it .
Seizing the Wishing Cap , he put it on , wished all the tradesmen , including the shoemaker , back in the town at their shops , and also wished that none of them should remember anything about the whole affair .
In a moment he was alone in the turret-room .
As for the shopkeepers , they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed something odd ; but , as it went no further , of course they did not talk about it , and nobody was any the wiser .
`` Owl that I am ! ''
said King Prigio to himself .
`` I might have better wished for a complete set of sham fairy things which would not work .
It would have saved a great deal of trouble ; but I am so much out of the habit of using the cap , that I never thought of it .
However , what I have got will do very well . ''
Then , putting on the Cap of Darkness , that nobody might see him , he carried all the real fairy articles away , except the Seven-league Boots , to his own room , where he locked them up , leaving in their place the sham Wishing Cap , the sham Cap of Darkness , the sham Sword of Sharpness , and the carpet which was not a magic carpet at all .
His idea was , of course , that Ricardo would start on an expedition confiding in his fairy things , and he would find that they did not act .
Then he would be left to his own cleverness and courage to get him out of the scrape .
That would teach him , thought the king , to depend on himself , and to set a proper value on cleverness and learning , and minding his book .
Of course he might have locked the things up , and forbidden Ricardo to touch them , but that might have seemed harsh .
And , as you may easily imagine , with all the powers at his command , the king fancied he could easily rescue Ricardo from any very serious danger at the hands of giants or magicians or monsters .
He only wanted to give him a fright or two , and make him respect the judgment of older and wiser people than himself .
For several days Prince Ricardo minded his books , and , according to his tutors , made considerable progress in polite learning .
Perhaps he ought not to be praised too highly for this , because , in fact , he saw no means of distinguishing himself by adventures just at that time .
Every morning he would climb the turret and sweep the horizon , and even much beyond the horizon , with the ivory spy-glass .
But look as he would , he saw no monsters preying on human-kind anywhere , nor princesses in distress .
To be sure he saw plenty of poor people in distress , and , being a good-hearted , though careless , lad , Dick would occasionally fly off with the Purse of Fortunatus in his pocket , and give them as much money as they needed -- it cost him nothing .
But this was not the kind of adventure which he enjoyed .
Dragons for his money !
One day the Princess Jaqueline took a curious plan of showing Ricardo how little interest , after all , there is in performing the most wonderful exploits without any real difficulty or danger .
They were drifting before a light breeze on a hill lake ; Ricardo was fishing , and Jaqueline was sculling a stroke now and then , just to keep the boat right with the wind .
Ricardo had very bad sport , when suddenly the trout began to rise all over the lake .
Dick got excited , and stumbled about the boat from stern to bow , tripping over Jaqueline's feet , and nearly upsetting the vessel in his hurry to throw his flies over every trout he saw feeding .
But , as too often occurs , they were taking one particular fly which was on the water , and would look at nothing else .
`` Oh , bother them ! ''
cried Ricardo .
`` I can't find a fly in my book in the least like that little black one they are feeding on ! ''
He tried half-a-dozen different fly-hooks , but all to no purpose ; he lost his temper , got his tackle entangled in Jaqueline's hair and then in the landing-net ; and , though such a big boy , he was nearly crying with vexation .
The Princess Jaqueline , with great pains and patience , disentangled the casting line , first from her hair , which Ricardo was anxious to cut , the great stupid oaf , -- her pretty hair ! ,
then from the landing-net ; but Dick had grown sulky .
`` It's no use , '' he said ; `` I have not a fly that will suit .
Let's go home , '' and he threw a tin can at a rising trout .
`` Now , Dick , '' said Jaqueline , `` you know I can help you .
I did not learn magic for nothing .
Just you look the other way for a minute or two , and you will find the right fly at the end of your line . ''
Dick turned his head away , it is not proper to look on at magical arts , and then in a moment , saw the right hook on his cast ; but Jaqueline was not in the boat .
She had turned herself into an artificial fly , a small black gnat , and Dick might set to his sport again .
`` What a trump that girl is , '' he said aloud .
`` Clever , too ! ''
and he began casting .
He got a trout every cast , great big ones , over a pound , and soon he had a basketful .
But he began to feel rather bored .
`` There's not much fun taking them , '' he said , `` when they are so silly . ''
At that very moment he noticed that the fly was off his cast , and Jaqueline was sitting at the oars .
`` You see , Ricardo , '' she said , `` I was right after all .
There is not much pleasure in sport that is easy and certain .
Now , apply this moral to dragon-killing with magic instruments .
It may be useful when one is obliged to defend oneself , but surely a prince ought not to give his whole time to nothing else ! ''
Dick had no answer ready , so he only grumbled : `` You 're always preaching at me , Jack ; everybody always is .
I seem to have been born just to be preached at . ''
Some people are ; and it does grow rather tedious in the long run .
But perhaps what Jaqueline said may have made some impression on Ricardo , for he stuck to his books for weeks , and was got into decimal fractions and Euclid .
All this , of course , pleased the king very much , and he began to entertain hopes of Ricardo's becoming a wise and learned prince , and a credit to his illustrious family .
Things were not always to go smoothly , far from it ; and it was poor Jaqueline who fell into trouble next .
She had been very ready to lecture Dick , as we saw , and took a good deal of credit to herself for his steadiness .
But one day King Prigio happened to meet Jaqueline's maid , Rosina , on the stairs ; and as Rosina was a pretty girl , and the king was always kind to his dependents , he stopped to have a chat with her .
`` Why , Rosina , what a pretty little silver cross you are wearing , '' he said , and he lifted a curious ornament which hung from a chain on Rosina's neck .
It consisted of seven drops of silver , set like this : `` May I look at it ? ''
his Majesty asked , and Rosina , all in a flutter , took it off and gave if to him .
`` H 'm ! ''
said the king .
`` Very curious and pretty !
May I ask you where you got this , Rosina ? ''
Now Rosina generally had her answer ready , and I am very sorry to say that she did not always speak the truth when she could think of anything better .
On this occasion she was anxious to think of something better , for fear of getting Jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom .
But Rosina was fluttered , as we said , by the royal kindness , and she could think of nothing but to curtsy , and say : `` Please , your Majesty , the princess gave me the drops . ''
`` Very interesting , '' said the king .
`` There is a little white moon shining in each of them !
I wonder if they shine in the dark ? ''
He opened the door of a cupboard which had no windows , where the housemaid kept her mops and brooms , and shut himself in .
Yes , there was no mistake ; the darkness was quite lighted up with the sheen of the seven little moons in the silver .
The king looked rather grave .
`` If you can trust me with this cross till to-morrow , Rosina , I should like to have it examined and analysed .
This is no common silver . ''
Of course Rosina could only curtsy , but she was very much alarmed about the consequences to her mistress .
After luncheon , the king asked Jaqueline to come into his study , as he often did , to help him with his letters .
When they had sat down his Majesty said : `` My dear Jaqueline , I never interfere with your pursuits , but I almost doubt whether Cornelius Agrippa is a good book for a very young lady to read .
The Fairy Paribanou , I am sure , taught you nothing beyond the ordinary magical accomplishments suited to your rank ; but there are a great many things in the Cornelius which I think you should not study till you are older and wiser . ''
`` What does your Majesty mean ? ''
said poor Jaqueline , feeling very uncomfortable ; for the king had never lectured her before .
`` Why , '' said his Majesty , taking the silver cross out of his pocket , `` did you not give this to Rosina ? ''
`` Yes , sire , I did give her the drops .
She had them made up herself . ''
`` Then give it back to her when you see her next .
I am glad you are frank , Jaqueline .
And you know , of course , that the drops are not ordinary silver ?
They are moon silver , and that can only be got in one way , so far as I know , at least -- when one spills the water when he , or she , is drinking the moon .
Now , there is only one book which tells how that can be done , and there is only one reason for doing it ; namely , to find out what is some other person's secret .
I shall not ask you whose secret you wanted to find out , but I must request you never to do such a thing again without consulting me .
You can have no reason for it , such as a great king might have whose enemies are plotting against his country . ''
`` Oh , sire , I will tell you everything ! ''
cried Jaqueline .
`` No , don't ; I don't want to know .
I am sure you will make no use of your information which you think I should not approve of .
But there is another thing -- that eclipse of the moon !
Oh , Jaqueline , was it honourable , or fair to the astronomers and men of science , to say nothing about it ?
Their European reputations are seriously injured . ''
Poor Jaqueline could only cry .
`` Never mind , '' said his Majesty , comforting her .
`` There is no great harm done yet , and perhaps they would not believe you if you did explain ; but just think , if some people ceased to believe in Science , what would they have left to believe in ?
But you are young , of course , and can not be expected to think of everything . ''
`` I never thought about it at all , '' wept Jaqueline . ''
` Evil is wrought by want of thought , ' '' said the king , quoting the poet .
`` Now run away , dry your tears , and I think you had better bring me that book , and I'll put it back in one of the locked-up shelves .
Later , when you are older , we shall see about it . ''
The princess flew to her room , and returned with her book .
And the king kissed her , and told her to go and see if her Majesty meant to take a drive .
`` I'll never deceive him again , never ... unless it is quite necessary , '' said the princess to herself .
`` Indeed , it is not so easy to deceive the king .
What a lot he has read ! ''
In fact , King Prigio had been very studious when a young man , before he came to the throne .
`` Poor child ! ''
thought the king .
`` No doubt she was trying her fortune , wondering if Ricardo cares for her a little .
Of course I could not let her tell me that , poor child ! ''
In this guess , as we know , his Majesty was mistaken , which seldom happened to him .
`` I wonder who she is ? ''
the king went on speaking to himself .
`` That great booby , Ricardo , saved her from wild birds , which were just going to eat her .
She was fastened to a mountain top , but where ?
that's the question .
Ricardo never has any notion of geography .
It was across the sea , he noticed that ; but which sea , -- Atlantic , Pacific , the Black Sea , the Caspian , the Sea of Marmora , the Red Sea , the Indian Ocean , the German Ocean , the Mediterranean ?
Her ornaments were very peculiar ; there was a broad gold sun on her breast .
I must look at them again some day .
She said she was being sacrificed to wild birds , which her people worshipped , because there was some famine , or war , or trouble in the country .
She said she was a Daughter of the Sun ; but that , of course , is absurd , unless -- By Jove !
I believe I have it , '' said the king , and he went into the royal library and was looking for some old Spanish book , when his secretary came and said that the Russian Ambassador was waiting for an interview with his Majesty .
`` Dismal old Muscovite ! ''
sighed the king .
`` A monarch has not a moment to himself for his private studies .
Ah , Prigio !
why wert thou not born to a private station ?
But Duty before everything , '' and wreathing his royal countenance in smiles , his Majesty prepared to give Count Snoreonski an audience .
It was all about the attitude of Pantouflia in the event of a Polish invasion of Russia .
The king reassured Count Snoreonski , affirming that Pantouflia , while deeply regretting the disturbed relations between two States in whose welfare she was deeply interested , would ever preserve an attitude of benevolent neutrality , unless her own interests were threatened .
`` I may give your message to my august mistress , the Czarina ? ''
said the ambassador .
`` By all means , adding an expression of my tender interest in her Majesty's health and welfare , '' said the king , presenting the count at the same time with a magnificent diamond snuffbox containing his portrait .
The old count was affected to tears , and withdrew , while King Prigio said : `` I have not lost a day ; I have made an amiable but very stupid man happy . ''
Such are , or rather such were , the toils of monarchs !
`` I say , Jack , '' said Prince Ricardo one morning , `` here's a queer letter for me ! ''
King Prigio had gone to a distant part of his dominions , on business of importance , and the young people were sitting in the royal study .
The letter , which Ricardo handed to Jaqueline , was written on a great broad sheet of paper , folded up without any envelope , as was the custom then , and was sealed with a huge seal in red wax .
`` I don't know the arms , '' Ricardo said .
`` Oh , Ricardo , how you do neglect your Heraldry !
Old Green Stocking is in despair over your ignorance . ''
Now Green Stocking was the chief herald of Pantouflia , just like Blue Mantle in England .
`` Why , these are the Royal Arms of England , you great ignorant Dick ! ''
`` But Rome isn't in England , is it ?
-- and the post-mark is ` Roma ' : that's Rome in some lingo , I expect .
It is in Latin , anyhow , I know .
Mortuus est Romae -- ` He died at Rome . '
It's in the Latin Grammar .
Let's see what the fellow says , anyhow , '' added Ricardo , breaking the seal .
`` He begins , ` Prins and dear Cousin ! '
I say , Jaqueline , he spells it ` Prins ; ' now it is P-R-I-N-C-E .
He must be an ignorant fellow ! ''
`` People in glass houses should not throw stones , Dick , '' said Jaqueline .
`` He signs himself ` Charles , P. W. , ' '' said Ricardo , looking at the end .
`` Who on earth can he be ?
Why does he not put ` P. W. Charles , ' if these are his initials ?
Look here , it's rather a long letter ; you might read it to us , Jack ! ''
The princess took the epistle and began : `` How nice it smells , all scented !
The paper is gilt-edged , too . ''
`` Luxurious beggar , whoever he is , '' said Ricardo .
`` Well , he says : ` Prins and dear Cousin , -- You and me ' , oh , what grammar ! ,
` are much the same age , I being fifteen next birthday , and we should be better ackwainted .
All the wurld has herd of the fame of Prins Ricardo , whose name is feerd , and his sord dreded , wherever there are Monsters and Tirants .
Prins , you may be less well informed about my situation .
I have not killed any Dragguns , there being nun of them here ; but I have been under fiar , at Gaeta . '
Where's Gaeta , Dick ? ''
`` Never heard of it , '' said Ricardo .
`` Well , it is in Italy , and it was besieged lately .
He goes on : ` and I am told that I did not misbehave myself , nor disgrace the blud of Bruce . ' ''
`` I've heard of Robert Bruce , '' said Dick ; `` he was the man who did not kill the spider , but he cracked the head of Sir Harry Bohun with one whack of his axe .
I remember him well enough . ''
`` Well , your correspondent seems to be a descendant of his . ''
`` That's getting more interesting , '' said Dick .
`` I wish my father would go to war with somebody .
With the Sword of Sharpness I 'd make the enemy whistle !
Drive on , Jack . '' ''
` As a prins in distress , I apeal to your valler , so renouned in Europe .
I am kept out of my own ; my royal father , King Gems , ' -- well , this is the worst spelling I ever saw in my life !
He means King James , -- ` my royal father , King Gems , being druv into exile by a crewl Usurper , the Elector of Hannover .
King Gems is old , and likes a quiat life ; but I am determined to make an effort , if I go alone , and Europe shall here of Prince Charles .
Having heard -- as who has not ?
-- of your royal Highness's courage and sordsmanship , I throw myself at your feet , and implore you to asist a prins in distres .
Let our sords be drawn together in the caus of freedom and an outraged country , my own . '' '
I remain , '' ` Prins and dear Cuzen , '' ` CHARLES , P. W. ' `` P. W. means Prince of Wales , '' added Jaqueline .
`` He is turned out of England you know , and lives at Rome with his father . ''
`` I like that chap , '' said Prince Ricardo .
`` He does not spell very well , as you say , but I sometimes make mistakes myself ; and I like his spirit .
I've been looking out for an adventure ; but the big game is getting shy , and my sword rusts in his scabbard .
I'll tell you what , Jack -- I've an idea !
I'll put him on the throne of his fathers ; it's as easy as shelling peas : and as for that other fellow , the Elector , I'll send him back to Hanover , wherever that may be , and he can go on electing , and polling his vote in peace and quietness , at home .
Just wait till I spot the places . ''
The prince ran up to the turret , fetched the magic spy-glass , and looked up London , Rome , and Hanover , as you would in a map .
`` Well , Dick , but how do you mean to do it ? ''
`` Do it ?
-- nothing simpler !
I just take my Seven-league Boots , run over to Rome , pick up Prince Charles , put him on the magic carpet , fly to London , clap the Cap of Darkness on him so that nobody can see him , set him down on the throne of his fathers ; pick up the Elector , carry him over to his beloved Hanover , and the trick is done -- what they call a bloodless revolution in the history books . ''
`` But if the English don't like Prince Charles when they get him ? ''
`` Like him ?
they 're sure to like him , a young fellow like that !
Besides , I'll take the sword with me in case of accidents . ''
`` But , Dick , it is your father's rule that you are never to meddle in the affairs of other countries , and never to start on an expedition when he is not at home . ''
`` Oh , he won't mind this time !
There's no kind of danger ; and I 'm sure he will approve of the principle of the thing .
Kings must stick up for each other .
Why , some electing characters might come here and kick us out ! ''
`` Your father is not the sort of king who is kicked out , '' said Jaqueline .
But there was no use in talking to Dick .
He made his simple preparations , and announced that he would be back in time for luncheon .
What was poor Jaqueline to do ?
She was extremely anxious .
She knew , as we saw , what King Prigio had intended about changing the fairy things for others that would not work .
She was certain Dick would get himself into a scrape ; how was she to help him ?
She made up her mind quickly , while Dick was putting his things together .
She told the queen , it was the nearest to the truth she could think of , that she `` was going for a turn with Dick . ''
Then she changed herself into a mosquito -- a kind of gnat that bites -- and hid herself under a fold of Dick's coat .
Of course he knew nothing about her being there .
Then he started off in his Seven - league Boots , and before you could say `` Jack Robinson '' he was in Rome , in the grounds of a splendid palace called the Villa Borghese .
There he saw an elderly gentleman , in a great curled wig , sound asleep on a seat beneath a tree .
The old gentleman had a long , pale , melancholy face , and across his breast was a broad blue ribbon with a star .
Ah !
how changed was King James from the handsome Prince who had loved fair Beatrix Esmond , thirty years ago !
Near him were two boys , not quite so old as Prince Ricardo .
The younger was a pretty dark boy , with a funny little roundabout white wig .
He was splendidly dressed in a light-blue silk coat ; a delicate little lace scarf was tied round his neck ; he had lace ruffles falling about his little ringed hands ; he had a pretty sword , with a gold handle set with diamonds -- in fact , he was the picture of a little dandy .
The other lad had a broad Scotch bonnet on , and no wig ; beautiful silky yellow locks fell about his shoulders .
He had laid his sword on the grass .
He was dressed in tartan , which Ricardo had never seen before ; and he wore a kilt , which was also new to Ricardo , who wondered at his bare legs -- for he was wearing shoes with no stockings .
In his hand he held a curious club , with a long , slim handle , and a head made heavy with lead , and defended with horn .
With this he was aiming at a little white ball ; and suddenly he swung up the club and sent the ball out of sight in the air , over several trees .
Prince Ricardo stepped up to this boy , took off his cap , and said : `` I think I have the honour of addressing the Prince of Wales ? ''
Prince Charles started at the sight of a gentleman in long riding-boots , girt with a broadsword , which was not then generally worn , and carrying a Persian rug under his arm .
`` That is what I am called , sir , '' he said , `` by those who give me the title which is mine by right .
May I inquire the reason which offers me the pleasure of this unexpected interview ? ''
`` Oh , I 'm Ricardo of Pantouflia ! ''
says Dick .
`` I had a letter from you this morning , and I believe you wanted to see me . ''
`` From Pantouflia , sir , '' said Prince Charles ; `` why , that is hundreds of leagues away ! ''
`` It is a good distance , '' said Dick ; `` but a mere step when you wear Seven - league Boots like mine . ''
`` My dear prince , '' said Charles , throwing himself into his arms with rapture , and kissing him in the Italian fashion , which Dick did not half like , `` you are , indeed , worthy of your reputation ; and these are the celebrated Seven-league Boots ?
Harry , '' he cried to his brother , `` come here at once and let me present you to his Royal Highness , our illustrious ally , Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia .
The Duke of York -- Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia .
Gentlemen , know each other ! ''
The prince bowed in the most stately manner .
`` I say , '' said Dick , who was seldom at all up to the standard of royal conversation , `` what's that game you were playing ?
It's new to me .
You sent the ball a tremendous long shot . ''
`` The game is called golf , and is the favourite pastime of my loyal Scottish subjects , '' said Prince Charles .
`` For that reason , that I may be able to share the amusements of my people , whom I soon hope to lead to a glorious victory , followed by a peaceful and prosperous reign , I am acquiring a difficult art .
I 'm practising walking without stockings , too , to harden my feet , '' he said , in a more familiar tone of voice .
`` I fancy there are plenty of long marches before me , and I would not be a spear's length behind the hardiest Highlander . ''
`` By Jove !
I respect you , '' said Dick , with the greatest sincerity ; `` but I don't think , with me on your side , you will need to make many marches .
It will all be plain sailing . ''
`` Pray explain your plan , '' said Prince Charles .
`` The task of conquering back the throne of my fathers is not so simple as you seem to suppose . ''
`` I've done a good many difficult things , '' said Dick , modestly .
`` The conqueror of the magician , Gorgonzola , and the Giant Who never Knew when he had Enough , need not tell me that , '' said Prince Charles , with a courteous allusion to two of Ricardo's most prodigious adventures .
`` Oh !
I've very little to be proud of , really , '' said Dick , blushing ; `` anyone could do as much with my fairy things , of which , no doubt , you have heard .
With a Sword of Sharpness and a Cap of Darkness , and so forth , you have a great pull over almost anything . ''
`` And you really possess those talismans ? ''
said the prince .
`` Certainly I do .
You see how short a time I took in coming to your call from Pantouflia . ''
`` And has Holy Church , '' asked the Duke of York , with anxiety , `` given her sanction and her blessing to those instruments of an art , usually , in her wisdom , forbidden ? ''
`` Oh , never mind Holy Church , Harry ! ''
said Prince Charles .
`` This is business .
Besides , the English are Protestants . ''
`` I pray for their conversion daily , '' said the Duke of York .
`` The end justifies the means , you know , '' answered Prince Charles .
`` All's fair in love and war . ''
`` I should think so , '' said Ricardo , `` especially against those brutes of Electors ; they give trouble at home sometimes . ''
`` You , too , are plagued with an Elector ? ''
asked Prince Charles . ''
An Elector ?
thousands of them ! ''
answered Dick , who never could understand anything about politics .
Prince Charles looked puzzled , but requested Dick to explain his great plan .
They sat down on the grass , and Ricardo showed them how he meant to manage it , just as he had told Jaqueline .
As he said , nothing could be simpler .
`` Let's start at once , '' he said , and , inducing Prince Charles to sit down on the magic carpet , he cried : `` England !
St. James's Palace ! ''
But nothing happened !
The carpet was not the right magic carpet , but the one which King Prigio had put in its place .
`` Get on !
England , I said ! ''
cried Dick .
But there they remained , under the chestnut tree , sitting on the carpet above the flowery grass .
Prince Charles leaped to his feet ; his face like fire , his eyes glowing .
`` Enough of this fooling , sir ! ''
he said .
`` It is easy , but cowardly , to mock at an unfortunate prince .
Take your carpet and be off with you , out of the gardens , or your shoulders shall taste my club . ''
`` There has been some mistake , '' Ricardo said ; `` the wrong carpet has been brought by accident , or the carpet has lost its power . ''
`` In this sacred city , blessed by the presence of his Holiness the Pope , and the relics of so many martyrs and saints , magic may well cease to be potent , '' said the Duke of York .
`` Nonsense !
You are an impostor , sir !
Leave my presence ! ''
cried Prince Charles , lifting his golf-club .
Dick caught it out of his hand , and broke across his knee as fine a driver as ever came from Robertson's shop at St. Andrew's .
`` The quarrels of princes are not settled with clubs , sir !
Draw and defend yourself ! ''
he said , kicking off his boots and standing in his socks on the grass .
Think of the horror of poor Jaqueline , who witnessed this terrible scene of passion from a fold in Prince Ricardo's dress !
What could the girl do to save the life of two princes , the hopes of one nation , and of a respectable minority in another ?
In a moment Prince Charles's rapier was shining in the sunlight , and he fell on guard in the most elegant attitude , his left hand gracefully raised and curved .
Dick drew his sword , but , as suddenly , threw it down again .
`` Hang it ! ''
he exclaimed , `` I can't hit you with this !
This is the Sword of Sharpness ; it would cut through your steel and your neck at a touch . ''
He paused , and thought .
`` Let me beseech your Royal Highness , '' he said to the Duke of York , who was in a terrible taking , `` to lend your blade to a hand not less royal than your own . ''
`` Give him it , Hal ! ''
said Prince Charles , who was standing with the point of his sword on the ground , and the blade bent .
`` He seems to believe in his own nonsense . ''
The duke yielded his sword ; Dick took it , made a nourish , and rushed at Prince Charles .
Now Ricardo had always neglected his fencing lessons .
`` Where's the good of it , '' he used to ask , `` all that stamping , and posture-making , and ha - haing ?
The Sword of Sharpness is enough for me . ''
But now he could not , in honour , use the Sword of Sharpness ; so on he came , waving the rapier like a claymore , and made a slice at Prince Charles's head .
The prince , very much surprised , parried in prime , riposted , and touched Dick on the hand .
At this moment the Princess Jaqueline did what she should have thought of sooner .
She flew out of Dick's coat , and stung old King James on his royal nose .
The king wakened , nearly crushed the princess , so dangerous is the practice of magic to the artist , and then leaped up , and saw Dick's blade flying through the air , glittering in the sun .
The prince had disarmed him .
`` Hullo !
what's all this ?
A moi , mes gardes ! ''
cried the old king , in French and English ; and then he ran up , just in time to hear Prince Charles say : `` Sir , take your life !
I can not strike an unarmed man .
A prince you may be , but you have not learned the exercises of gentlemen . ''
`` What is all this , Carluccio ? ''
asked the old king .
`` Swords out !
brawling in my very presence !
blood drawn ! ''
for Dick's hand was bleeding a good deal .
Prince Charles , as briefly as possible , explained the unusual nature of the circumstances .
`` A king must hear both sides , '' said King James .
`` What reply have you , sir , to make to his Royal Highness's statements ? ''
`` The carpet would not work , sir , '' said Dick .
`` It never happened before .
Had I used my own sword , '' and he explained its properties , `` the Prince of Wales would not be alive to tell his story .
I can say no more , beyond offering my apology for a disappointment which I could not have foreseen .
A gentleman can only say that he is sorry .
But wait ! ''
he added ; `` I can at least prove that my confidence in some of my resources is not misplaced .
Bid me bring you something -- anything -- from the ends of the earth , and it shall be in your hands .
I can't say fairer . ''
King James reflected , while Prince Ricardo was pulling on the Seven-league Boots , which he had kicked off to fight more freely , and while the Duke of York bandaged Dick's hand with a kerchief .
`` Bring me , '' said his Majesty , `` Lord Lovat's snuff-mull . ''
`` Where does he live ? ''
said Dick .
`` At Gortuleg , in Scotland , '' answered King James .
Dick was out of sight before the words were fairly spoken , and in ten minutes was back , bearing a large ram's - horn snuff-box , with a big cairngorm set in the top , and the Frazer arms .
`` Most astonishing ! ''
said King James .
`` A miracle ! ''
said the Duke of York .
`` You have entirely cleared your character , '' said the king .
`` Your honour is without a stain , though it is a pity about the carpet .
Your nobility in not using your magical sword , under the greatest provocation , reconciles me to this fresh blighting of my hopes .
All my allies fail me , '' said the poor king with a sigh ; `` you alone have failed with honour .
Carluccio , embrace the prince ! ''
They fell into each other's arms .
`` Prince , '' said Dick , `` you have taught me a lesson for which I shall not be ungrateful .
With any blade a gentleman should be able to hold his own in fair fight .
I shall no longer neglect my fencing lessons . ''
`` With any blade , '' said Prince Charles , `` I shall be happy to find Prince Ricardo by my side in a stricken field .
We shall not part till I have induced you to accept a sword which I can never hope to draw against another adversary so noble .
In war , my weapon is the claymore . ''
Here the prince offered to Ricardo the ruby-studded hilt of his rapier , which had a beautiful white shark-skin sheath .
`` You must accept it , sir , '' said King James ; `` the hilt holds the rubies of John Sobieski . ''
`` Thank you , prince , '' said Ricardo , `` for the weapon , which I shall learn to wield ; and I entreat you to honour me by receiving this fairy gift -- which you do not need -- a ring which makes all men faithful to the wearer . ''
The Prince of Wales bowed , and placed the talisman on his finger .
Ricardo then , after a few words of courtesy on both parts , picked up his useless carpet , took his farewell of the royal party , and , with Jaqueline still hidden under his collar , returned at full speed , but with a heavy heart , to Pantouflia , where the palace gong was just sounding for luncheon .
Ricardo never interfered in foreign affairs again , but his ring proved very useful to Prince Charles , as you may have read in history .
The queen , as it happened fortunately , was lunching with one of the ladies of her Court .
Ricardo did not come down to luncheon , and Jaqueline ate hers alone ; and very mournful she felt .
The prince had certainly not come well out of the adventure .
He had failed , as all attempts to restore the Stuarts always did ; he had been wounded , though he had never received a scratch in any of his earlier exploits ; and if his honour was safe , and his good intentions fully understood , that was chiefly due to Jaqueline , and to the generosity of King James and Prince Charles .
`` I wonder what he's doing ? ''
she said to herself , and at last she went up and knocked at Ricardo's door .
`` Go away , '' he said ; `` I don't want to see anybody .
Who is it ? ''
`` It's only me -- Jaqueline . ''
`` Go away !
I want nobody . ''
`` Do let me in , dear Dick ; I have good news for you , '' said the princess .
`` What is it ? ''
said Ricardo , unlocking the door .
`` Why do you bother a fellow so ? ''
He had been crying -- his hand obviously hurt him badly ; he looked , and indeed he was , very sulky .
`` How did you get on in England , Dick ? ''
asked the princess , taking no notice of his bandaged hand .
`` Oh , don't ask me ! ''
said Ricardo .
`` I've not been to England at all . ''
`` Why , what happened ? ''
`` Everything that is horrid happened , '' said Dick ; and then , unable to keep it any longer to himself , he said : `` I've failed to keep my promise ; I've been insulted , I've been beaten by a fellow younger than myself ; and , oh !
how my hand does hurt , and I've got such a headache !
And what am I to say to my mother when she asks why my arm is in a sling ?
and what will my father say ?
I 'm quite broken down and desperate .
I think I'll run away to sea ; '' and indeed he looked very wild and miserable .
`` Tell me how it all happened , Dick , '' said the princess ; `` I 'm sure it's not so bad as you make out .
Perhaps I can help you . ''
`` How can a girl help a man ? ''
cried Dick , angrily ; and poor Jaqueline , remembering how she had helped him , at the risk of her own life , when King James nearly crushed her in the shape of a mosquito , turned her head away , and cried silently .
`` I 'm a beast , '' said Dick .
`` I beg your pardon , Jack dear .
You are always a trump , I will say ; but I don't see what you can do . ''
Then he told her all the story , which , of course , she knew perfectly well already , except the part played by the mosquito , of which he could not be aware .
`` I was sure it was not so bad as you made it out , Dick , '' she said .
`` You see , the old king , who is not very wise , but is a perfectly honourable gentleman , gave you the highest praise . ''
She thought of lecturing him a little about disobeying his father , but it did not seem a good opportunity .
Besides , Jaqueline had been lectured herself lately , and had not enjoyed it .
`` What am I to say to my mother ? ''
Dick repeated .
`` We must think of something to say , '' said Jaqueline .
`` I can't tell my mother anything but the truth , '' Ricardo went on .
`` Here's my hand , how it does sting !
and she must find out . ''
`` I think I can cure it , '' said Jaqueline .
`` Didn't you say Prince Charles gave you his own sword ? ''
`` Yes , there it is ; but what has that to do with it ? ''
`` Everything in the world to do with it , my dear Dick .
How lucky it is that he gave it to you ! ''
And she ran to her own room , and brought a beautiful golden casket , which contained her medicines .
Taking out a small phial , marked , in letters of emerald , : `` WEAPON SALVE , '' the princess drew the bright sword , extracted a little of the ointment from the phial , and spread it on a soft silk handkerchief .
`` What are you going to do with the sword ? ''
asked Ricardo .
`` Polish it a little , '' said Jaqueline , smiling , and she began gently to rub , with the salve , the point of the rapier .
As she did so , Ricardo's arm ceased to hurt , and the look of pain passed from his mouth .
`` Why , I feel quite better ! ''
he said .
`` I can use my hand as well as ever . ''
Then he took off the stained handkerchief , and , lo , there was not even a mark where the wound had been !
For this was the famous Weapon Salve which you may read about in Sir Kenelm Digby , and which the Lady of Branxholme used , in The Lay of the Last Minstrel .
But the secret of making it has long been lost , except in Pantouflia .
`` You are the best girl in the world , Jaqueline , '' said Ricardo .
`` You may give me a kiss if you like ; and I won't call you ` Jack , ' or laugh at you for reading books , any more .
There's something in books after all . ''
The princess did not take advantage of Dick's permission , but advised him to lie down and try to sleep .
`` I say , though , '' he said , `` what about my father ? ''
`` The king need never be told anything about it , '' said Jaqueline , `` need he ? ''
`` Oh , that won't do !
I tell my father everything ; but then , I never had anything like this to tell him before .
Don't you think , Jaqueline , you might break it to him ?
He's very fond of you .
Just tell him what I told you ; it's every word of it true , and he ought to know .
He might see something about it in the Mercure de France . ''
This was the newspaper of the period .
`` I don't think it will get into the papers , '' said Jaqueline , smiling .
`` Nobody could tell , except the king and the princes , and they have reasons for keeping it to themselves . ''
`` I don't trust that younger one , '' said Dick , moodily ; `` I don't care for that young man .
Anyway , my father must be told ; and , if you won't , I must . ''
`` Well , I'll tell him , '' said Jaqueline .
`` And now lie down till evening . ''
After dinner , in the conservatory , Jaqueline told King Prigio all about it .
His Majesty was very much moved .
`` What extraordinary bad luck that family has ! ''
he thought .
`` If I had not changed the rug , the merest accident , Prince Charles would have dined at St. James's to-night , and King George in Hanover .
It was the very nearest thing ! ''
`` This meddling with practical affairs will never do , '' he said aloud .
`` Dick has had a lesson , sire , '' said the princess .
`` He says he'll never mix himself up with politics again , whatever happens .
And he says he means to study all about them , for he feels frightfully ignorant , and , above all , he means to practise his fencing . ''
These remarks were not part of the conversation between Ricardo and Jaqueline , but she considered that Dick meant all this , and , really , he did .
`` That is well , as far as it goes , '' said the king .
`` But , Jaqueline , about that mosquito ? ''
for she had told him this part of the adventure .
`` That was a very convenient mosquito , though I don't know how Dick was able to observe it from any distance .
I see your hand in that , my dear , and I am glad you can make such kind and wise use of the lessons of the good Fairy Paribanou .
Jaqueline , '' he added solemnly , laying his hand on her head , `` You have saved the honour of Pantouflia , which is dearer to me than life .
Without your help , I tremble to think what might have occurred . ''
The princess blushed very much , and felt very happy .
`` Now run away to the queen , my dear , '' said his Majesty , `` I want to think things over . ''
He did think them over , and the more he thought the more he felt the inconvenience attending the possession of fairy things .
`` An eclipse one day , as nearly as possible a revolution soon after ! ''
he said to himself .
`` But for Jaqueline , Ricardo's conduct would have been blazed abroad , England would have been irritated .
It is true she can not get at Pantouflia very easily ; we have no sea-coast , and we are surrounded by friendly countries .
But it would have been a ticklish and discreditable position .
I must really speak to Dick , '' which he did next morning after breakfast .
`` You have broken my rules , Ricardo , '' he said .
`` True , there is no great harm done , and you have confessed frankly ; but how am I to trust you any longer ? ''
`` I'll give you my sacred word of honour , father , that I'll never meddle with politics again , or start on an expedition , without telling you .
I have had enough of it .
And I'll turn over a new leaf .
I've learned to be ashamed of my ignorance ; and I've sent for Francalanza , and I'll fence every day , and read like anything . ''
`` Very good , '' said the king .
`` I believe you mean what you say .
Now go to your fencing lesson . ''
`` But , I say , father , '' cried Ricardo , `` was it not strange about the magic carpet ? ''
`` I told you not to trust to these things , '' said the king .
`` Some enchanter may have deprived it of its power , it may be worn out , someone may have substituted a common Persian rug ; anything may happen .
You must learn to depend on yourself .
Now , be off with you , I 'm busy .
And remember , you don't stir without my permission . ''
The prince ran off , and presently the sounds of stamping feet and '' un , deux ; doublez , degagez , vite ; contre de carte , '' and so forth , might be heard over a great part of the royal establishment .
`` There is one brute I wish I could get upsides with , '' said Ricardo , at breakfast one morning , his mouth full of sardine .
`` Really , Ricardo , your language is most unprincely , '' said his august father ; `` I am always noticing it .
You mean , I suppose , that there is one enemy of the human race whom you wish to abolish .
What is the name of the doomed foe ? ''
`` Well , he is the greatest villain in history , '' said Ricardo .
`` You must have read about him , sir , the Yellow Dwarf . ''
`` Yes , I have certainly studied what is told us about him , '' said the king .
`` He is no favourite of mine . ''
`` He is the only one , if you notice , sir , of all the scoundrels about whom our ancestors inform us , who escaped the doom which he richly merited at the sword of a good knight . ''
You may here remark that , since Dick took to his studies , he could speak , when he chose , like a printed book , which was by no means the case before .
`` If you remember , sir , he polished off -- I mean , he slew -- the King of the Golden Mines and the beautiful , though frivolous , Princess Frutilla .
All that the friendly Mermaid could do for them was to turn them into a pair of beautiful trees which intertwine their branches .
Not much use in that , sir !
And nothing was done to the scoundrel .
He may be going on still ; and , with your leave , I'll go and try a sword-thrust with him .
Francalanza says I 'm improving uncommon . ''
`` You'll take the usual Sword of Sharpness , '' said his Majesty .
`` What , sir , to a dwarf ?
Not I , indeed : a common small sword is good enough to settle him . ''
`` They say he is very cunning of fence , '' said the king ; `` and besides , I have heard something of a diamond sword that he stole from the King of the Golden Mines . ''
`` Very likely he has lost it or sold it , the shabby little miscreant ; however , I'll risk it .
And now I must make my preparations . ''
The king did not ask what they were ; as a rule , they were simple .
But , being in the shop of the optician that day , standing with his back to the door , he heard Dick come in and order a pair of rose-coloured spectacles , with which he was at once provided .
The people of Pantouflia were accustomed to wear them , saying that they improved the complexions of ladies whom they met , and added cheerfulness to things in general .
`` Just plain rose-coloured glass , Herr Spex , '' said Dick , `` I 'm not short - sighted . ''
`` The boy is beginning to show some sense , '' said the king to himself , knowing the nature and the difficulties of the expedition .
Ricardo did not disguise his intention of taking with him a Dandie Dinmont terrier , named Pepper , and the king , who understood the motive of this precaution , silently approved .
`` The lad has come to some purpose and forethought , '' the king said , and he gladly advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of crocodiles ' eggs , which can rarely be got quite fresh .
When Jaqueline had made the crocodiles ' eggs , with millet-seed and sugar-candy , into a cake for the Dwarf's lions , Ricardo announced that his preparations were complete .
Not to be the mere slave of custom , he made this expedition on horseback , and the only magical thing he took with him was the Cap of Darkness , the one which would not work , but he did not know that , and this he put in his pocket for future use .
With plenty of egg sandwiches and marmalade sandwiches , and cold minced-collop sandwiches , he pricked forth into the wilderness , making for the country inhabited by the Yellow Dwarf .
The princess was glad he was riding , for she privately accompanied him in the disguise of a wasp ; and a wasp , of course , could not have kept up with him in his Seven-league Boots .
`` Hang that wops ! ''
said Prince Ricardo several times , buffeting it with his pocket-handkerchief when it buzzed in his ear and round his horse's head .
Meanwhile , King Prigio had taken his precautions , which were perfectly simple .
When he thought Ricardo was getting near the place , the king put on his Wishing Cap , sat down before the magic crystal ball , and kept his eye on the proceedings , being ready to wish the right thing to help Ricardo at the right moment .
He left the window wide open , smoked his cigar , and seemed the pattern of a good and wise father watching the conduct of a promising son .
The prince rode and rode , sometimes taking up Pepper on his saddle ; passing through forests , sleeping at lonely inns , fording rivers , till one day he saw that the air was becoming Yellow .
He knew that this showed the neighbourhood of Jaunia , or Daunia , the country of the Yellow Dwarf .
He therefore drew bridle , placed his rose-coloured spectacles on his nose and put spurs to his horse , for the yellow light of Jaunia makes people melancholy and cowardly .
As he pricked on , his horse stumbled and nearly came on its nose .
The prince noticed that a steel chain had been drawn across the road .
`` What caitiff has dared ! ''
he exclaimed , when his hat was knocked off by a well-aimed orange from a neighbouring orange-tree , and a vulgar voice squeaked : `` Hi , Blinkers ! ''
There was the Yellow Dwarf , an odious little figure , sitting sucking an orange in the tree , swinging his wooden shoes , and grinning all over his wrinkled face .
`` Well , young Blinkers ! ''
said the Dwarf , `` what are you doing on my grounds ?
You 're a prince , by your look .
Yah !
down with kings !
I 'm a man of the people ! ''
`` You 're a dwarf of the worst description , that's what you are , '' said Ricardo ; `` and let me catch you , and I'll flog the life out of you with my riding-whip ! ''
The very face of the Dwarf , even seen through rose-coloured spectacles , made him nearly ill .
`` Yes , when you can catch me , '' said the Dwarf ; `` but that's not to-day , nor yet to-morrow .
What are you doing here ?
Are you an ambassador , maybe come to propose a match for me ?
I 'm not proud , I'll hear you .
They say there's a rather well-looking wench in your parts , the Princess Jaqueline -- '' `` Mention that lady's name , you villain , '' cried Dick , `` and I'll cut down your orange-tree ! ''
and he wished he had brought the Sword of Sharpness , for you can not prod down a tree with the point of a rapier .
`` Fancy her yourself ? ''
said the Dwarf , showing his yellow teeth with a detestable grin ; while Ricardo turned quite white with anger , and not knowing how to deal with this insufferable little monster .
`` I 'm a widower , I am , '' said the Dwarf , `` though I 'm out of mourning , '' for he wore a dirty clay-coloured Yellow jacket .
`` My illustrious consort , the Princess Frutilla , did not behave very nice , and I had to avenge my honour ; in fact , I 'm open to any offers , however humble .
Going at an alarming sacrifice !
Come to my box '' , and he pointed to a filthy clay cottage , all surrounded by thistles , nettles , and black boggy water , `` and I'll talk over your proposals . ''
`` Hold your impudent tongue ! ''
said Dick .
`` The Princess Frutilla was an injured saint ; and as for the lady whom I shall not name in your polluting presence , I am her knight , and I defy you to deadly combat ! ''
We may imagine how glad the princess was when , disguised as a wasp , she heard Dick say he was her knight ; not that , in fact , he had thought of it before .
`` Oh !
you 're for a fight , are you ? ''
sneered the Dwarf .
`` I might tell you to hit one of your own weight , but I 'm not afraid of six of you .
Yah !
mammy's brat !
Look here , young Blinkers , I don't want to hurt you .
Just turn old Dobbin's head , and trot back to your mammy , Queen Rosalind , at Pantouflia .
Does she know you 're out ? ''
`` I'll be into you , pretty quick , '' said Ricardo .
`` But why do I bandy words with a miserable peasant ? ''
`` And don't get much the best of them either , '' said the Dwarf , provokingly .
`` But I'll fight , if you will have it . ''
The prince leaped from his horse , leaving Pepper on the saddle-bow .
No sooner had he touched the ground than the Dwarf shouted : `` Hi !
to him , Billy !
to him , Daniel !
at him , good lions , at him ! ''
and , with an awful roar , two lions rushed from a neighbouring potato-patch and made for Ricardo .
These were not ordinary lions , history avers , each having two heads , each being eight feet high , with four rows of teeth ; their skins as hard as nails , and bright red , like morocco .
The prince did not lose his presence of mind ; hastily he threw the cake of crocodiles ' eggs , millet-seed , and sugar-candy to the lions .
This is a dainty which lions can never resist , and running greedily at it , with four tremendous snaps , they got hold of each other by their jaws , and their eight rows of teeth were locked fast in a grim and deadly struggle for existence !
The Dwarf took in the affair at a glance .
`` Cursed be he who taught you this ! ''
he cried , and then whistled in a shrill and vulgar manner on his very dirty fingers .
At his call rushed up an enormous Spanish cat , ready saddled and bridled , and darting fire from its eyes .
To leap on its back , while Ricardo sprang on his own steed , was to the active Dwarf the work of a moment .
Then clapping spurs to its sides , his spurs grew naturally on his bare heels , horrible to relate , like a cock's spurs , and taking his cat by the head , the Dwarf forced it to leap on to Ricardo's saddle .
The diamond sword which slew the king of the Golden Mines -- that invincible sword which hews iron like a reed -- was up and flashing in the air !
At this very moment King Prigio , seeing , in the magic globe , all that passed , and despairing of Ricardo's life , was just about to wish the dwarf at Jericho , when through the open window , with a tremendous whirr , came a huge vulture , and knocked the king's wishing cap off !
Wishing was now of no use .
This odious fowl was the Fairy of the Desert , the Dwarf's trusted ally in every sort of mischief .
The vulture flew instantly out of the window ; and ah !
with what awful anxiety the king again turned his eyes on the crystal ball only a parent's heart can know .
Should he see Ricardo bleeding at the feet of the abominable dwarf ?
The king scarcely dared to look ; never before had he known the nature of fear .
However , look he did , and saw the dwarf un-catted , and Pepper , the gallant Dandie Dinmont , with his teeth in the throat of the monstrous Spanish cat .
No sooner had he seen the cat leap on his master's saddle-bow than Pepper , true to the instinct of his race , sprang at its neck , just behind the head -- the usual place , -- and , with an awful and despairing mew , the cat , Peter was its name , gave up its life .
The dwarf was on his feet in a moment , waving the diamond sword , which lighted up the whole scene , and yelling taunts .
Pepper was flying at his heels , and , with great agility , was keeping out of the way of the invincible blade .
`` Ah ! ''
screamed the Dwarf as Pepper got him by the ankle .
`` Call off your dog , you coward , and come down off your horse , and fight fair ! ''
At this moment , bleeding yellow blood , dusty , mad with pain , the dwarf was a sight to strike terror into the boldest .
Dick sprang from his saddle , but so terrific was the appearance of his adversary , and so dazzling was the sheen of the diamond sword , that he put his hand in his pocket , drew out , as he supposed , the sham Cap of Darkness , and placed it on his head .
`` Yah !
who's your hatter ? ''
screamed the infuriated dwarf . ''
I see you ! ''
and he disengaged , feinted in carte , and made a lunge in seconde at Dick which no mortal blade could have parried .
The prince , thanks to his excellent training , just succeeded in stepping aside , but the dwarf recovered with astonishing quickness .
`` Coward , lache , poltroon , runaway ! ''
he hissed through his clenched teeth , and was about to make a thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal , when the Princess Jaqueline , in her shape as a wasp , stung him fiercely on the wrist .
With an oath so awful that we dare not set it down , the dwarf dropped the diamond sword , sucked his injured limb , and began hopping about with pain .
In a moment Prince Ricardo's foot was on the blade of the diamond sword , which he passed thrice through the body of the Yellow Dwarf .
Squirming fearfully , the little monster expired , his last look a defiance , his latest word an insult : `` Yah !
Gig-lamps ! ''
Prince Ricardo wiped the diamond blade clean from its yellow stains .
`` Princess Frutilla is avenged ! ''
he cried .
Then pensively looking at his fallen foe , `` Peace to his ashes , '' he said ; `` he died in harness ! ''
Turning at the word , he observed that the two lions were stiff and dead , locked in each other's gory jaws !
At that moment King Prigio , looking in the crystal ball , gave a great sigh of relief .
`` All's well that ends well , '' he said , lighting a fresh cigar , for he had allowed the other to go out in his excitement , `` but it was a fight !
I am not satisfied , '' his Majesty went on reflecting , `` with this plan of changing the magical articles .
The first time was of no great importance , and I could not know that the boy would start on an expedition without giving me warning .
But , in to-day's affair he owes his safety entirely to himself and Pepper , '' for he had not seen the wasp .
`` The Fairy of the Desert quite baffled me : it was terrible .
I shall restore the right fairy things to-night .
As to the Fairy of the Desert , '' he said , forgetting that his Wishing Cap was on , `` I wish she were dead ! ''
A hollow groan and the sound of a heavy body falling interrupted the king .
He looked all about the room , but saw nothing .
He was alone !
`` She must have been in the room , invisible , '' said the king ; and , of course , she has died in that condition .
`` But I must find her body ! ''
The king groped about everywhere , like a blind man , and at last discovered the dead body of the wicked fairy lying on the sofa .
He could not see it , of course , but he felt it with his hands .
`` This is very awkward , '' he remarked .
`` I can not ring for the servants and make them take her away .
There is only one plan . ''
So he wished she were in her family pyramid , in the Egyptian desert , and in a second the sofa was unoccupied .
`` A very dangerous and revengeful enemy is now removed from Ricardo's path in life , '' said his Majesty , and went to dress for dinner .
Meanwhile Ricardo was riding gaily home .
The yellow light of Jaunia had vanished , and pure blue sky broke overhead as soon as the dauntless Dwarf had drawn his latest breath .
The poor , trembling people of the country came out of their huts and accompanied Dick , cheering , and throwing roses which had been yellow roses , but blushed red as soon as the Dwarf expired .
They attended him to the frontiers of Pantouflia , singing his praises , which Ricardo had the new and inestimable pleasure of knowing to be deserved .
`` It was sharp work , '' he said to himself , `` but much more exciting and glorious than the usual business . ''
On his return Dick did not fail to mention the wasp , and again the king felt how great was his debt to Jaqueline .
But they did not think it well to trouble the good queen with the dangers Dick had encountered .
One morning the post brought a truly enormous letter for Dick .
It was as broad as a table-cloth , and the address was written in letters as long as a hoop-stick .
`` I seem to know that hand , '' said Ricardo ; `` but I thought the fingers which held the pen had long been cold in death . ''
He opened , with his sword , the enormous letter , which was couched in the following terms : `` The Giant as does not know when he has had enuf , presents his compliments to Prince Ricardo ; and I , having recovered from the effects of our little recent rally , will be happy to meet you in the old place for a return-match .
I not being handy with the pen , the Giant hopes you will excuse mistakes and bad writing . ''
Dick simply gazed with amazement .
`` If ever I thought an enemy was killed and done for , it was that Giant , '' said he .
`` Why , I made mere mince-collops of him ! ''
However , he could not refuse a challenge , not to speak of his duty to rid the world of so greedy and odious a tyrant .
Dick , therefore , took the usual things , which the king had secretly restored , but first he tried them -- putting on the Cap of Darkness before the glass , in which he could not see himself .
On second thoughts , he considered it unfair to take the cap .
All the other articles were in working order .
Jaqueline on this occasion followed him in the disguise of a crow , flying overhead .
On reaching the cavern -- a huge tunnel in the rock -- where the Giant lived , Ricardo blew a blast on the horn which hung outside , and in obedience to a written notice , knocked also with a mace provided by the Giant for that purpose .
Presently he heard heavy footsteps sounding along the cavern , and the Giant came out .
He was above the common height for giants , and his whole face and body were seamed over with little red lines , crossing each other like tartan .
These were marks of encounters , in which he had been cut to bits and come together again ; for this was his peculiarity , which made him so dangerous .
If you cut off his head , he went on just as before , only without it ; and so about everything else .
By dint of magic , he could put his head on again , just as if it had been his hat , if you gave him time enough .
On the last occasion of their meeting , Ricardo had left him in a painfully scattered condition , and thought he was done for .
But now , except that a bird had flown away with the little finger of his left hand and one of his ears , the Giant was as comfortable as anyone could be in his situation .
`` Mornin ' sir , '' he said to Dick , touching his forehead with his hand .
`` Glad to see you looking so well .
No bad feeling , I hope , on either side ? ''
`` None on mine , certainly , '' said Ricardo , holding out his hand , which the Giant took and shook ; `` but Duty is Duty , and giants must go .
The modern world has no room for them . ''
`` That's hearty , '' said the Giant ; `` I like a fellow of your kind .
Now , shall we toss for corners ? ''
`` All right ! ''
said Dick , calling `` Heads '' and winning .
He took the corner with the sun on his back and in the Giant's face .
To it they went , the Giant aiming a blow with his club that would have felled an elephant .
Dick dodged , and cut off the Giant's feet at the ankles .
`` First blood for the prince ! ''
said the Giant , coming up smiling .
`` Half - minute time ! ''
He occupied the half-minute in placing the feet neatly beside each other , as if they had been a pair of boots .
Round 2 .
-- The Giant sparring for wind , Ricardo cuts him in two at the waist .
The Giant folded his legs up neatly , like a pair of trousers , and laid them down on a rock .
He had now some difficulty in getting rapidly over the ground , and stood mainly on the defensive , and on his waist .
Round 3 .
-- Dick bisects the Giant .
Both sides now attack him on either hand , and the feet kick him severely .
`` No kicking ! ''
said Dick .
`` Nonsense ; all fair in war ! ''
said the Giant .
But do not let us pursue this sanguinary encounter in all its horrible details .
Let us also remember -- otherwise the scene would be too painful for an elegant mind to contemplate with entertainment -- that the Giant was in excellent training , and thought no more of a few wounds than you do of a crack on the leg from a cricket-ball .
He well deserved the title given him by the Fancy , of `` The Giant who does not Know when he has had Enough . ''
* * * * * The contest was over ; Dick was resting on a rock .
The lists were strewn with interesting but imperfect fragments of the Giant , when a set of double teeth of enormous size flew up out of the ground and caught Ricardo by the throat !
In vain he strove to separate the teeth , when the crow , stooping from the heavens , became the Princess Jaqueline , and changed Dick into a wren -- a tiny bird , so small that he easily flew out of the jaws of the Giant and winged his way to a tree , whence he watched the scene .
But the poor Princess Jaqueline !
To perform the feat of changing Dick into a bird she had , of course , according to all the laws of magic , to resume her own natural form !
There she stood , a beautiful , trembling maiden , her hands crossed on her bosom , entirely at the mercy of the Giant !
No sooner had Dick escaped than the monster began to collect himself ; and before Jaqueline could muster strength to run away or summon to her aid the lessons of the Fairy Paribanou , the Giant who never Knew when he had Enough was himself again .
A boy might have climbed up a tree , for giants are no tree-climbers , any more than the grizzly bear , but Jaqueline could not climb .
She merely stood , pale and trembling .
She had saved Dick , but at an enormous sacrifice , for the sword and the Seven - league Boots were lying on the trampled grass .
He had not brought the Cap of Darkness , and , in the shape of a wren , of course he could not carry away the other articles .
Dick was rescued , that was all , and the Princess Jaqueline had sacrificed herself to her love for him .
The Giant picked himself up and pulled himself together , as we said , and then approached Jaqueline in a very civil way , for a person of his breeding , head in hand .
`` Let me introduce myself , '' he said , and mentioned his name and titles .
`` May I ask what you are doing here , and how you came ? ''
Poor Jaqueline threw herself at his feet , and murmured a short and not very intelligible account of herself .
`` I don't understand , '' said the Giant , replacing his head on his shoulders .
`` What to do with you , I 'm sure I don't know . '
Please don't eat me , ' did you say ?
Why , what do you take me for ?
I 'm not in that line at all ; low , I call it ! ''
Jaqueline was somewhat comforted at these words , dropped out of the Giant's lips from a considerable height .
`` But they call you ` The Giant who does not Know when he has had Enough , ' '' said Jaqueline .
`` And proud of the title : not enough of fighting .
Of punishment I am a glutton , or so my friends are pleased to say .
A brace of oxen , a drove of sheep or two , are enough for me , '' the Giant went on complacently , but forgetting to mention that the sheep and the oxen were the property of other people .
`` Where am I to put you till your friends come and pay your ransom ? ''
the Giant asked again , and stared at Jaqueline in a perplexed way .
`` I can't take you home with me , that is out of the question .
I have a little woman of my own , and she's not very fond of other ladies ; especially , she would like to poison them that have good looks . ''
Now Jaqueline saw that the Giant , big as he was , courageous too , was afraid of his wife !
`` I'll tell you what I'll do ; I'll hand you over to a neighbour of mine , who is a bachelor . ''
`` A bachelor giant ; would that be quite proper ? ''
said Jaqueline , trying to humour him .
`` He's not a giant , bless you ; he's a queer fellow , it is not easy to say what he is .
He's the Earthquaker , him as shakes the earth now and then , and brings the houses about people's ears . ''
Jaqueline fairly screamed at hearing this awful news .
`` Hush !
be quiet , do ! ''
said the Giant .
`` You'll bring out my little woman , and she is not easy to satisfy with explanations when she finds me conversing with a lady unbeknown to her .
The Earthquaker won't do you any harm ; it's only for safe keeping I'll put you with him .
Why , he don't waken , not once in fifty years .
He's quite the dormouse .
Turns on his bed now and then , and things upstairs get upset , more or less ; but , as a rule , a child could play with him .
Come on ! ''
Then , taking Jaqueline up on one hand , on which she sat as if on a chair , he crossed a few ranges of mountains in as many strides .
In front was one tall blue hill , with a flattened peak , and as they drew near the princess felt a curious kind of wind coming round her and round her .
You have heard of whirlpools in water ; well , this was just like a whirlpool of air .
Even the Giant himself could hardly keep his legs against it ; then he tossed Jaqueline up , and the airy whirlpool seized her and carried her , as if on a tide of water , always round and round in narrowing circles , till she was sucked down into the hollow hill .
Even as she went , she seemed to remember the hill , as if she had dreamed about it , and the shape and colour of the country .
But presently she sank softly on to a couch , in a beautifully-lighted rocky hall .
All around her the floor was of white and red marble , but on one side it seemed to end in black nothing .
Jaqueline , after a few moments , recovered her senses fully , and changing herself into an eagle , tried to fly up and out .
But as soon as she was in the funnel , the whirlpool of air always sucking down and down , was too strong for her wings .
She was a prisoner in this great gleaming hall , ending in black nothingness .
So she resumed her usual form , and walking to the edge of the darkness , found that it was not empty air , but something black , soft , and strong -- something living .
It had no form or shape , or none that she could make out ; but it pulsed with a heart .
Jaqueline placed her foot on this curious thing , when a voice came , like thunder heard through a feather-bed : `` Not near time to get up yet ! ''
and then there was a snore , and the great hall rocked like a ship at sea .
It was the Earthquaker !
The habits of this monstrous animal are very little known , as , of course , he never comes above ground , or at least very seldom , when he makes tracks like a dry river-bed across country .
We are certain that there are Earthquakers , otherwise how can we account for earthquakes ?
But how to tackle an Earthquaker , how to get at him , and what to do with him when you have got at him , are questions which might puzzle even King Prigio .
It was not easy to have the better of an enchantress like Jaqueline and a prince like Ricardo .
In no ordinary circumstances could they have been baffled and defeated ; but now it must be admitted that they were in a very trying and alarming situation , especially the princess .
The worst of it was , that as Jaqueline sat and thought and thought , she began to remember that she was back in her own country .
The hills were those she used to see from her father's palace windows when she was a child .
And she remembered with horror that once a year her people used to send a beautiful girl to the Earthquaker , by way of keeping him quiet , as you shall hear presently .
And now she heard light footsteps and a sound of weeping , and lo !
a great troop of pretty girls passed , sweeping in and out of the halls in a kind of procession , and looking unhappy and lost .
Jaqueline ran to them .
`` Where am I ?
who are you ? ''
she cried , in the language of her own country , which came back to her on a sudden .
`` We are nurses of the Earthquaker , '' they said .
`` Our duty is to sing him asleep , and every year he must have a new song ; and every year a new maiden must be sent down from earth , with a new sleepy song she has learned from the priests of Manoa , the City of the Sun .
Are you the new singer ? ''
`` No , I 'm not , '' said Jaqueline .
`` I don't know the priests of Manoa ; I don't know any new sleepy song .
I only want to find the way out . ''
`` There is no way , or we should have found it , '' said one of the maidens ; `` and , if you are the wrong girl , by the day after to-morrow they must send the right one , otherwise the Earthquaker will waken , and shake the world , and destroy Manoa , the City of the Sun . ''
Then they all wept softly in the stillness .
`` Can we get anything to eat here ? ''
asked poor Jaqueline , at last .
She was beginning to be very hungry , and however alarmed she might be , she felt that dinner would not be unwelcome .
The tallest of the maidens clapped her hands , and immediately a long table was spread by unseen sprites with meringues and cold chicken , and several sorts of delicious ices .
We shall desert Jaqueline , who was rather less alarmed when she found that she was not to be starved , at all events , and return to Prince Ricardo , whom we left fluttering about as a little golden-crested wren .
He followed the Giant and Jaqueline into the whirlpool of air as far as he dared , and when he saw her vanish down the cone of the hill , he flew straight back to Pantouflia .
A weary and way-worn little bird was Prince Ricardo when he fluttered into the royal study window , in the palace of Pantouflia .
The king was out at a council meeting ; knowing that Ricardo had the right things , all in good order , he was not in the least anxious about him .
The king was out , but Semiramis was in -- Semiramis , the great grey cat , sitting on a big book on the top of the library steps .
Now Semiramis was very fond of birds , and no sooner did Ricardo enter and flutter on to a table than Semiramis gathered herself together and made one fell spring at him .
She just caught his tail feather .
In all his adventures the prince had never been in greater danger .
He escaped , but no more , and went flying round the ceiling , looking for a safe place .
Finally he perched on a chandelier that hung from the roof .
Here he was safe ; and so weary was he , that he put his head under his wing and fell fast asleep .
He was awakened by the return of the king , who threw himself on a sofa and exclaimed : `` Oh , that Prime Minister !
his dulness is as heavy as lead ; much heavier , in fact ! ''
Then his Majesty lit a cigar and took up a volume ; he certainly was a sad bookworm .
Dick now began to fly about the room , brushing the king's face and trying to attract his notice .
`` Poor little thing ! ''
said his Majesty .
And Dick alighted , and nestled in his breast .
On seeing this , Semiramis began to growl , as cats do when they are angry , and slowly approached his Majesty .
`` Get out , Semiramis ! ''
said the king ; and lifting her by the neck , he put her out of the room and shut the door , at which she remained scratching and mewing .
Dick now crept out of the royal waistcoat , flew to the king's ear , twittered , pointed out of the window with one claw , and , lying down on his back , pretended to be dead .
Then he got up again , twittered afresh , pointed to the Wishing Cap , and , finally , convinced the king that this was no common fowl .
`` An enchanted prince or princess , '' said Prigio , `` such as I have often read of .
Who can it be ?
Not Jaqueline ; she could change herself back in a moment .
By the way , where is Jaqueline ? ''
He rang the bell , and asked the servant to look for the princess .
Semiramis tried to come in , but was caught and shut up downstairs .
After doing this , the man replied that her Royal Highness had not been in the palace all day .
The king rushed to the crystal ball , looked all the world over ; but no princess !
He became very nervous , and at that moment Dick lighted on the crystal ball , and put his claw on the very hill where Jaqueline had disappeared .
Then he cocked his little eye at the king .
`` Nay , she is somewhere in the unknown centre of South America , '' said his Majesty ; `` somewhere behind Mount Roraima , where nobody has ever been .
I must look into this . ''
Then he put on the Wishing Cap , and wished that the bird would assume his natural shape if he was under enchantment , as there seemed too good reason to believe .
Instantly Dick stood before him .
`` Ricardo ! ''
cried the king in horror ; `` and in this disguise !
Where have you been ?
What have you done with Jaqueline ?
Where are the Seven-league Boots ?
Where is the Sword of Sharpness ?
Speak !
Get up ! ''
for Dick was kneeling and weeping bitterly at the royal feet .
`` All lost ! ''
said Dick .
`` Poor Jaqueline !
she was the best girl , and the prettiest , and the kindest .
And the Earthquaker's got her , and the Giant's got the other things , '' Dick ended , crying bitterly .
`` Calm yourself , Ricardo , '' said his Majesty , very pale , but calm and determined .
`` Here , take a glass of port , and explain how all this happened . ''
Dick drank the wine , and then he told his miserable story .
`` You may well sob !
Why didn't you use the Cap of Darkness ?
Mere conceit !
But there is no use in crying over spilt milk .
The thing is , to rescue Jaqueline .
And what are we to say to your mother ? ''
`` That's the worst of it all , '' said Dick .
`` Mother will break her heart . ''
`` I must see her at once , '' said the king , `` and break it to her . ''
This was a terrible task ; but the queen had such just confidence in her Prigio that she soon dried her tears , remarking that Heaven would not desert Jaqueline , and that the king would find a way out of the trouble .
His Majesty retired to his study , put his head in his hands , and thought and thought .
`` The thing is , of course , '' he said , `` to destroy the Earthquaker before he wakens ; but how ?
What can kill such a monster ?
Prodding him with the sword would only stir him up and make him more vicious .
And I know of no other beast we can set against him , as I did with the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast , when I was young .
Oh , for an idea ! ''
Then his mind , somehow , went back to the Council and the ponderous stupidity of the Prime Minister .
`` Heavier than lead , '' said the king .
`` By George !
I have a plan .
If I could get to the place where they keep the Stupidity , I could carry away enough of it to flatten out the Earthquaker . ''
Then he remembered how , in an old Italian poem , he had read about all the strange lumber-room of odd things which is kept in the moon .
That is the advantage of reading : Knowledge is Power ; and you mostly get knowledge that is really worth having out of good old books which people do not usually read .
`` If the Stupidity is kept in stock , up in the moon , and comes from there , falling naturally down on the earth in small quantities , I might obtain enough for my purpose , '' thought King Prigio .
`` But -- how to get to the moon ?
There are difficulties about that . ''
But difficulties only sharpened the ingenuity of this admirable king .
`` The other fellow had a Flying Horse , '' said he .
By `` the other fellow '' King Prigio meant an Italian knight , Astolfo , who , in old times , visited the moon , and there found and brought back the common sense of his friend , Orlando , as you may read in the poem of Ariosto .
`` Now , '' reasoned King Prigio , `` if there is a Flying Horse at all , he is in the stables of the King of Delhi .
I must look into this . ''
Taking the magic spy-glass , the king surveyed the world from China to Peru , and , sure enough , there was the famous Flying Horse in the king's stable at Delhi .
Hastily the king thrust his feet into the Shoes of Swiftness -- so hastily , indeed , that , as the poet says , he `` madly crammed a left-hand foot into a right-hand shoe . ''
But this , many people think , is a sign of good luck ; so he put the shoes on the proper feet , and in a few minutes was in the presence of the Great Mogul .
The monarch received him with some surprise , but with stately kindness , and listened to Prigio while he explained what he wanted .
`` I am only too happy to assist so adventurous a prince , '' remarked the Great Mogul .
`` This is like old times !
Every horse in my stable is at your service , but , as you say , only the Flying Horse is of any use to you in this expedition . ''
He clapped his hands , the Grand Vizier appeared , and the king gave orders to have the Flying Horse saddled at once .
He then presented King Prigio with a large diamond , and came down into the courtyard to see him mount .
`` He's very fresh , '' said the groom who held the bridle ; `` has not been out of the stable for three hundred years ! ''
Prigio sprang into the saddle among the salaams of the dusky multitude , and all the ladies of the seraglio waved their scented handkerchiefs out of the windows .
The king , as he had been instructed , turned a knob of gold in the saddle of the Flying Horse , then kissed his hand to the ladies , and , giving the steed his head , cried , in excellent Persian : `` To the moon ! ''
Up flew the horse with an easy action , and the king's head nearly swam with the swiftness of the flight .
Soon the earth below him was no bigger than a top , spinning on its own axis , see Geography books for this , and , as night fell , earth was only a great red moon .
Through the dark rode King Prigio , into the silver dawn of the moon .
All now became clear and silvery ; the coasts of the moon came into sight , with white seas breaking on them ; and at last the king reached the silver walls , and the gate of opal .
Before the gate stood two beautiful ladies .
One was fair , with yellow locks , the colour of the harvest moon .
She had a crown of a golden snake and white water-lilies , and her dress now shone white , now red , now golden ; and in her hand was the golden pitcher that sheds the dew , and a golden wand .
The other lady was as dark as night -- dark eyes , dark hair ; her crown was of poppies .
She held the ebony Wand of Sleep .
Her dress was of the deepest blue , sown with stars .
The king knew that they were the maidens of the bright and the dark side of the moon -- of the side you see , and of the side that no one has ever seen , except King Prigio .
He stopped the Flying Horse by turning the other knob in the saddle , alighted , and bowed very low to each of the ladies .
`` Daring mortal !
what make you here ? ''
they asked .
And then the king told them about Jaqueline and the Earthquaker , and how he needed a great weight of Stupidity to flatten him out with .
The ladies heard him in silence , and then they said : `` Follow us , '' and they flew lightly beside the Flying Horse till they had crossed all the bright side of the moon , above the silver palaces and silver seas , and reached the summit of the Mountains of the Moon which separate the bright from the dark side .
`` Here I may go no further , '' said the bright lady ; `` and beyond , as you see , all is darkness and heavy sleep . ''
Then she touched Prigio with her golden wand with twisted serpents , and he became luminous , light raying out from him ; and the dark lady , too , shone like silver in the night : and on they flew , over black rocks and black rivers , till they reached a huge mountain , like a mountain of coal , many thousand feet high , for its head was lost in the blackness of darkness .
The dark Moon-Lady struck the rock with her ebony wand , and said , `` Open ! ''
and the cliffs opened like a door , and they were within the mountain .
`` Here , '' said the dark lady , `` is the storehouse of all the Stupidity ; hence it descends in showers like Stardust on the earth whenever this mountain , which is a volcano , is in eruption .
Only a little of the Stupidity reaches the earth , and that only in invisible dust ; yet you know how weighty it is , even in that form . ''
`` Indeed , madam , '' said the king , `` no one knows it better than I do . ''
`` Then make your choice of the best sort of Stupidity for your purpose , '' said the dark lady .
And in the light which flowed from their bodies King Prigio looked round at the various kinds of Solid Stupidity .
There it all lay in masses -- the Stupidity of bad Sermons , of ignorant reviewers , of bad poems , of bad speeches , of dreary novels , of foolish statesmen , of ignorant mobs , of fine ladies , of idle , naughty boys and girls ; and the king examined them all , and all were very , very heavy .
But when he came to the Stupidity of the Learned -- of dull , blind writers on Shakspeare , and Homer , and the Bible -- then King Prigio saw that he had found the sort he wanted , and that a very little of it would go a long way .
He never could have got it on the saddle of the Flying Horse if the dark lady had not touched it with her ebony wand , and made it light to carry till it was wanted for his purpose .
When he needed it for use , he was to utter a certain spell , which she taught him , and then the lump would recover its natural weight .
So he easily put a great block on his saddle-bow , and he and the dark lady flew back till they reached the crest of the Mountains of the Moon .
There she touched him with her ebony wand , and the silver light which the bright lady had shed on him died from his face and his body , and he became like other men .
`` You see your way ? ''
said the dark lady , pointing to the bright moon of earth , shining far off in the heavens .
Then he knelt down and thanked her , and she murmured strange words of blessing which he did not understand ; but her face was grave and kind , and he thought of Queen Rosalind , his wife .
Then he jumped on the Flying Horse , galloped down and down , till he reached his palace gate ; called for Ricardo , set him behind him on the saddle , and away they rode , above land and wide seas , till they saw the crest of the hollow hill , where Jaqueline was with the Earthquaker .
Beyond it they marked the glittering spires and towers of Manoa , the City of the Sun ; and `` Thither , '' said King Prigio , who had been explaining how matters stood , to Ricardo , `` we must ride , for I believe they stand in great need of our assistance . ''
`` Had we not better go to Jaqueline first , sir ? ''
said Ricardo .
`` No , '' said the king ; `` I think mine is the best plan .
Manoa , whose golden spires and pinnacles are shining below us , is the City of the Sun , which Sir Walter Raleigh and the Spaniards could never find , so that men have doubted of its existence .
We are needed there , to judge by that angry crowd in the marketplace .
How they howl ! ''
It was on a strange sight that the king and Ricardo looked down from the Flying Horse .
Beneath them lay the City of Manoa , filling with its golden battlements and temples a hollow of the mountains .
Here were palaces all carved over with faces of men and beasts , and with twisted patterns of serpents .
The city walls were built of huge square stones , and among the groves towered pyramids , on which the people did service to their gods .
From every temple top came the roar of beaten drums , great drums of serpentskin .
But , in the centre of the chief square of the town , was gathered a wild crowd of men in shining copper armour and helmets of gold and glittering dresses of feathers .
Among them ran about priests with hideous masks , crying them on to besiege and break down the royal palace .
From the battlements of the palace the king's guardsmen were firing arrows and throwing spears .
The mob shot arrows back , some of them tipped with lighted straw , to burn the palace down .
But , in the very centre of the square , was a clear space of ground , on which fell the shadow of a tall column of red stone , all carved with serpents and faces of gods .
Beside it stood a figure horrible to see : a man clothed in serpent skins , whose face was the grinning face of a skull ; but the skull was shining black and red in patches , and a long white beard flowed from beneath it .
This man , mounted on a kind of altar of red stone , waved his hand and yelled , and seemed to point to the shadow of the column which fell across the square .
The people were so furious and so eager that they did not , at first , notice King Prigio as he slowly descended .
But at last the eyes within the skull looked up and saw him , and then the man gave a great cry , rent his glittering dress of serpentskin , and held up his hands .
Then all the multitude looked up , and seeing the Flying Horse , let their weapons fall ; and the man of the skull tore it from his face , and knelt before King Prigio , with his head in the dust .
`` Thou hast come , oh , Pachacamac , as is foretold in the prophecy of the Cord of the Venerable Knots !
Thou hast come , but behold the shadow of the stone !
Thou art too late , oh Lord of the Earth and the Sea ! ''
Then he pointed to the shadow , which , naturally , was growing shorter , as the sun drew near mid-day .
He spoke in the language of the ancient Incas of Peru , which of course Prigio knew very well ; and he also knew that Pachacamac was the god of that people .
`` I have come , '' Prigio said , with presence of mind , `` as it has been prophesied of old . ''
`` Riding on a beast that flies , '' said the old priest , `` even as the oracle declared .
Glory to Pachacamac , even though we die to-day ! ''
`` In what can I help my people ? ''
said Prigio .
`` Thou knowest ; why should we instruct thee ?
Thou knowest that on midsummer-day , every year , before the shadow shrinks back to the base of the huaca of Manoa , we must offer a maiden to lull the Earthquaker with a new song .
Lo , now the shadow shrinks to the foot of the huaca , and the maid is not offered !
For the lot fell on the daughter of thy servant the Inca , and he refuses to give her up .
One daughter of his , he says , has been sacrificed to the sacred birds , the Cunturs : the birds were found slain on the hill-top , no man knows how ; but the maiden vanished . ''
`` Why , it must have been Jaqueline .
I killed the birds , '' said Ricardo , in Pantouflian .
`` Silence , not a word ! ''
said the king , sternly .
`` And what makes you bear arms against the Inca ? ''
he asked the old man .
`` We would slay him and her , '' answered the priest ; `` for , when the shadow shrinks to the foot of the stone , the sun will shine straight down into the hollow hill of the Earthquaker , and he will waken and destroy Manoa and the Temples of the Sun . ''
`` Then wherefore would you slay them , when you must all perish ? ''
`` The people , oh Pachacamac , would have revenge before they die . ''
`` Oh , folly of men ! ''
said the king , solemnly ; then he cried : `` Lead me to the Inca ; this day you shall not perish .
Is it not predicted in the Cord of the Venerable Knots that I shall slay this monster ? ''
`` Hasten , oh Pachacamac , for the shadow shortens ! ''
said the priest .
`` Lead me to the Inca , '' answered Prigio .
At this the people arose with a great shout , for they , too , had been kneeling ; and , sending a flag of truce before King Prigio , the priest led him into the palace .
The ground was strewn with bodies of the slain , and through them Prigio rode slowly into the courtyard , where the Inca was sitting in the dust , weeping and throwing ashes on his long hair and his golden raiment .
The king bade the priest remain without the palace gates ; then dismounted , and , advancing to the Inca , raised him and embraced him .
`` I come , a king to a king , '' he said .
`` My cousin , take courage ; your sorrows are ended .
If I do not slay the Earthquaker , sacrifice me to your gods . ''
`` The Prophecy is fulfilled , '' said the Inca , and wept for joy .
`` Yet thou must hasten , for it draws near to noon . ''
Then Prigio went up to the golden battlements , and saying no word , waved his hand .
In a moment the square was empty , for the people rushed to give thanks in the temples .
`` Wait my coming , my cousin , '' said Prigio to the Inca ; `` I shall bring you back the daughter that was lost , when I have slain your enemy . ''
The Inca would have knelt at his feet ; but the king raised him , and bade him prepare such a feast as had never been seen in Manoa .
`` The lost are found to-day , '' he said ; `` be you ready to welcome them . ''
Then , mounting the Flying Horse , with Dick beside him , he rose towards the peak of the hill where the Earthquaker had his home .
Already the ground was beginning to tremble ; the Earthquaker was stirring in his sleep , for the maiden of the new song had not been sent to him , and the year ended at noon , and then he would rise and ruin Manoa .
The sun was approaching mid-day , and Prigio put spurs to the Flying Horse .
Ten minutes more , and the sun would look straight down the crater of the hollow hill , and the Earthquaker would arouse himself when the light and the heat fell on his body .
Already the light of the sun shone slanting half-way down the hollow cone as the whirlpool of air caught the Flying Horse , and drew him swiftly down and down to the shadowy halls .
There knelt and wept the nurses of the Earthquaker on the marble floor ; but Jaqueline stood a little apart , very pale , but not weeping .
Ricardo had leaped off before the horse touched the ground , and rushed to Jaqueline , and embraced her in his arms ; and , oh !
how glad she was to see him , so that she quite forgot her danger and laughed for joy .
`` Oh !
you have come , you have come ; I knew you would come ! ''
she cried .
Then King Prigio advanced , the mighty weight in his hand , to the verge of the dreadful gulf of the Earthquaker .
The dim walls grew radiant ; a long slant arm of yellow light touched the black body of the Earthquaker , and a thrill went through him , and shook the world , so that , far away , the bells rang in Pantouflia .
A moment more , and he would waken in his strength ; and once awake , he would shatter the city walls and ruin Manoa .
Even now a great mass of rock fell from the roof deep down in the secret caves , and broke into flying fragments , and all the echoes roared and rang .
King Prigio stood with the mighty mass poised in his hands .
`` Die ! ''
he cried ; and he uttered the words of power , the magic spell that the dark Moon Lady had taught him .
Then all its invincible natural weight came into the mass which the king held , and down it shot full on the body of the Earthquaker ; and where that had been was nothing but a vast abyss , silent , empty , and blank , and bottomless .
Far , far below , thousands of miles below , in the very centre of the earth , lay the dead Earthquaker , crushed flat as a sheet of paper , and the sun of midsummer-day shone straight down on the dreadful chasm , and could not waken him any more for ever .
The king drew a long breath .
`` Stupidity has saved the world , '' he said ; and , with only strength to draw back one step from the abyss , he fell down , hiding his face in his hands .
But Jaqueline's arms were round his neck , and the maidens brought him water from an ice-cold spring ; and soon King Prigio was himself again , and ready for anything .
But afterwards he used to say that the moment when the Earthquaker stirred was the most dreadful in his life .
Now , in Manoa , where all the firm foundations of the city had trembled once , when the sun just touched the Earthquaker , the people , seeing that the shadow of the sacred column had crept to its foot , and yet Manoa stood firm again , and the Temple of the Sun was not overthrown , raised such a cry that it echoed even through the halls within the hollow hill .
Who shall describe the joy of the maidens , and how often Jaqueline and Ricardo kissed each other ?
`` You have saved me ! ''
she cried to the king , throwing her arms round him again .
`` You have saved Manoa ! ''
`` And you have saved the Hope of Pantouflia , not once or twice , '' said his Majesty , grandly .
And he told Dick how much he had owed to Jaqueline , in the fight with the Yellow Dwarf , and the fight with the Giant , for he did not think it necessary to mention the affair at Rome .
Then Dick kissed Jaqueline again , and all the maidens kissed each other , and they quite cried for gladness .
`` But we keep his Majesty the Inca waiting , '' said Prigio .
`` Punctuality is the courtesy of kings .
You ladies will excuse me , I am sure , if I remove first from the dungeon her whom we call the Princess Jaqueline .
The Inca , her father , has a claim on us to this preference . ''
Then placing Jaqueline on the saddle , and leaving Dick to comfort the other young ladies , who were still rather nervous , the king flew off to Manoa , for the wind , of course , died with the death of the Earthquaker .
I can not tell you the delight of all Manoa , and of the Inca , when they saw the Flying Horse returning , and recognised their long-lost princess , who rushed into the arms of her father .
They beat the serpent drums , for they had no bells , on the tops of the temples .
They went quite mad with delight : enemies kissed in the streets ; and all the parents , without exception , allowed all the young people who happened to be in love to be married that very day .
Then Prigio brought back all the maidens , one after the other , and Dick last ; and he fell at the Inca's feet , and requested leave to marry Jaqueline .
But , before that could be done , King Prigio , mounted on the palace balcony , made a long but very lucid speech to the assembled people .
He began by explaining that he was not their God , Pachacamac , but king of a powerful country of which they had never heard before , as they lived very much withdrawn in an unknown region of the world .
Then he pointed out , in the most considerate manner , that their religion was not all he could wish , otherwise they would never sacrifice young ladies to wild birds and Earthquakers .
He next sketched out the merits of his own creed , that of the Lutheran Church ; and the Inca straightway observed that he proposed to establish it in Manoa at once .
Some objection was raised by the old priest in the skull mask ; but when the Inca promised to make him an archbishop , and to continue all his revenues , the priest admitted that he was perfectly satisfied ; and the general public cheered and waved their hats with emotion .
It was arranged that the Inca , with his other daughters , should visit Pantouflia immediately , both because he could not bear to leave Jaqueline , and also because there were a few points on which he felt that he still needed information .
The Government was left in the hands of the archbishop , who began at once by burning his skull mask , you may see one like it in the British Museum , in the Mexican room , and by letting loose all the birds and beasts which the Manoans used to worship .
So all the young people were married in the Golden Temple of the Sun , and all the Earthquaker's nurses who were under thirty were wedded to the young men who had been fond of them before they were sent into the hollow hill .
These young men had never cared for any one else .
Everybody wore bridal favours , all the unengaged young ladies acted as bridesmaids , and such a throwing of rice and old shoes has very seldom been witnessed .
As for the happy royal pair , with their fathers , and the other princess , who did not happen to be engaged , back they flew to Pantouflia .
And there was Queen Rosalind waiting at the palace gates , and crying and laughing with pleasure when she heard that the wish of her heart was fulfilled , and Jaqueline was to be her daughter .
`` And , as for the Earthquaker , '' said her Majesty , `` I never was really anxious in the least , for I knew no beast in the world was a match for you , my dear . ''
So , just to make everything orderly and correct , Ricardo and Jaqueline were married over again , in the Cathedral of Pantouflia .
The marriage presents came in afterwards , of course , and among them , what do you think ?
Why , the Seven-League Boots and the Sword of Sharpness , with a very polite note of extraordinary size : `` The Giant who does not Know when he has had Enough presents his hearty congratulations to the royal pair , and begs to lay at their feet the Seven-league Boots , they not fitting me , and the Sword which Prince Ricardo left in the Giant's keeping recently .
The Giant hopes no bad blood ; and I am , `` Yours very faithfully , `` THE G. , & c. `` P.S. -- His little woman sends her congratulations . ''
So you see the Giant was not such a bad sort of fellow after all , and Prince Ricardo always admitted that he never met a foe more gallant and good-humoured .
With such a clever wife , Ricardo easily passed all his examinations ; and his little son , Prince Prigio , named after his august grandfather , never had to cry , `` Mamma , mamma , father's plucked again . ''
So they lived happily in a happy country , occasionally visiting Manoa ; and as they possessed the magical Water o Life from the Fountain of Lions , I do not believe that any of them ever died at all , but that Prigio is still King of Pantouflia .
