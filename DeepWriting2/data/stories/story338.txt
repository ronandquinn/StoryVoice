Nan was polishing the tumblers at the pantry window , outside of which John Osborne was leaning among the vines .
His arms were folded on the sill and his straw hat was pushed back from his flushed , eager face as he watched Nan's deft movements .
Beyond them , old Abe Stewart was mowing the grass in the orchard with a scythe and casting uneasy glances at the pair .
Old Abe did not approve of John Osborne as a suitor for Nan .
John was poor ; and old Abe , although he was the wealthiest farmer in Granville , was bent on Nan's making a good match .
He looked upon John Osborne as a mere fortune-hunter , and it was a thorn in the flesh to see him talking to Nan while he , old Abe , was too far away to hear what they were saying .
He had a good deal of confidence in Nan , she was a sensible , level-headed girl .
Still , there was no knowing what freak even a sensible girl might take into her head , and Nan was so determined when she did make up her mind .
She was his own daughter in that .
However , old Abe need not have worried himself .
It could not be said that Nan was helping John Osborne on in his wooing at all .
Instead , she was teasing and snubbing him by turns .
Nan was very pretty .
Moreover , Nan was well aware of the fact .
She knew that the way her dark hair curled around her ears and forehead was bewitching ; that her complexion was the envy of every girl in Granville ; that her long lashes had a trick of drooping over very soft , dark eyes in a fashion calculated to turn masculine heads hopelessly .
John Osborne knew all this too , to his cost .
He had called to ask Nan to go with him to the Lone Lake picnic the next day .
At this request Nan dropped her eyes and murmured that she was sorry , but he was too late -- she had promised to go with somebody else .
There was no need of Nan's making such a mystery about it .
The somebody else was her only cousin , Ned Bennett , who had had a quarrel with his own girl ; the latter lived at Lone Lake , and Ned had coaxed Nan to go over with him and try her hand at patching matters up between him and his offended lady-love .
And Nan , who was an amiable creature and tender-hearted where anybody's lover except her own was concerned , had agreed to go .
But John Osborne at once jumped to the conclusion -- as Nan had very possibly meant him to do -- that the mysterious somebody was Bryan Lee , and the thought was gall and wormwood to him .
`` Whom are you going with ? ''
he asked .
`` That would be telling , '' Nan said , with maddening indifference .
`` Is it Bryan Lee ? ''
demanded John .
`` It might be , '' said Nan reflectively , `` and then again , you know , it mightn't . ''
John was silent ; he was no match for Nan when it came to a war of words .
He scowled moodily at the shining tumblers .
`` Nan , I 'm going out west , '' he said finally .
Nan stared at him with her last tumbler poised in mid-air , very much as if he had announced his intention of going to the North Pole or Equatorial Africa .
`` John Osborne , are you crazy ? ''
`` Not quite .
And I 'm in earnest , I can tell you that . ''
Nan set the glass down with a decided thud .
John's curtness displeased her .
He needn't suppose that it made any difference to her if he took it into his stupid head to go to Afghanistan .
`` Oh ! ''
she remarked carelessly .
`` Well , I suppose if you've got the Western fever your case is hopeless .
Would it be impertinent to inquire why you are going ? ''
`` There's nothing else for me to do , Nan , '' said John , `` Bryan Lee is going to foreclose the mortgage next month and I'll have to clear out .
He says he can't wait any longer .
I've worked hard enough and done my best to keep the old place , but it's been uphill work and I 'm beaten at last . ''
Nan sat blankly down on the stool by the window .
Her face was a study which John Osborne , watching old Abe's movements , missed .
`` Well , I never ! ''
she gasped .
`` John Osborne , do you mean to tell me that Bryan Lee is going to do that ?
How did he come to get your mortgage ? ''
`` Bought it from old Townsend , '' answered John briefly .
`` Oh , he's within his rights , I'll admit .
I've even got behind with the interest this past year .
I'll go out west and begin over again . ''
`` It's a burning shame ! ''
said Nan violently .
John looked around in time to see two very red spots on her cheeks .
`` You don't care though , Nan . ''
`` I don't like to see anyone unjustly treated , '' declared Nan , `` and that is what you've been .
You've never had half a chance .
And after the way you've slaved , too ! ''
`` If Lee would wait a little I might do something yet , now that Aunt Alice is gone , '' said John bitterly .
`` I 'm not afraid of work .
But he won't ; he means to take his spite out at last . ''
Nan hesitated .
`` Surely Bryan isn't so mean as that , '' she stammered .
`` Perhaps he'll change his mind if -- if -- '' Osborne wheeled about with face aflame .
`` Don't you say a word to him about it , Nan ! ''
he cried .
`` Don't you go interceding with him for me .
I've got some pride left .
He can take the farm from me , and he can take you maybe , but he can't take my self-respect .
I won't beg him for mercy .
Don't you dare to say a word to him about it . ''
Nan's eyes flashed .
She was offended to find her sympathy flung back in her face .
`` Don't be alarmed , '' she said tartly .
`` I shan't bother myself about your concerns .
I've no doubt you 're able to look out for them yourself . ''
Osborne turned away .
As he did so he saw Bryan Lee driving up the lane .
Perhaps Nan saw it too .
At any rate , she leaned out of the window .
`` John !
John ! ''
Osborne half turned .
`` You'll be up again soon , won't you ? ''
His face hardened .
`` I'll come to say goodbye before I go , of course , '' he answered shortly .
He came face to face with Lee at the gate , where the latter was tying his sleek chestnut to a poplar .
He acknowledged his rival's condescending nod with a scowl .
Lee looked after him with a satisfied smile .
`` Poor beggar ! ''
he muttered .
`` He feels pretty cheap I reckon .
I've spoiled his chances in this quarter .
Old Abe doesn't want any poverty-stricken hangers-on about his place and Nan won't dream of taking him when she knows he hasn't a roof over his head . ''
He stopped for a chat with old Abe .
Old Abe approved of Bryan Lee .
He was a son-in-law after old Abe's heart .
Meanwhile , Nan had seated herself at the pantry window and was ostentatiously hemming towels in apparent oblivion of suitor No. 2 .
Nevertheless , when Bryan came up she greeted him with an unusually sweet smile and at once plunged into an animated conversation .
Bryan had not come to ask her to go to the picnic -- business prevented him from going .
But he meant to find out if she were going with John Osborne .
As Nan was serenely impervious to all hints , he was finally forced to ask her bluntly if she was going to the picnic .
Well , yes , she expected to .
Oh !
Might he ask with whom ?
Nan didn't know that it was a question of public interest at all .
`` It isn't with that Osborne fellow , is it ? ''
demanded Bryan incautiously .
Nan tossed her head .
`` Well , why not ? ''
she asked .
`` Look here , Nan , '' said Lee angrily , `` if you 're going to the picnic with John Osborne I 'm surprised at you .
What do you mean by encouraging him so ?
He's as poor as Job's turkey .
I suppose you've heard that I've been compelled to foreclose the mortgage on his farm . ''
Nan kept her temper sweetly -- a dangerous sign , had Bryan but known it .
`` Yes ; he was telling me so this morning , '' she answered slowly .
`` Oh , was he ?
I suppose he gave me my character ? ''
`` No ; he didn't say very much about it at all .
He said of course you were within your rights .
But do you really mean to do it , Bryan ? ''
`` Of course I do , '' said Bryan promptly .
`` I can't wait any longer for my money , and I 'd never get it if I did .
Osborne can't even pay the interest . ''
`` It isn't because he hasn't worked hard enough , then , '' said Nan .
`` He has just slaved on that place ever since he grew up . ''
`` Well , yes , he has worked hard in a way .
But he's kind of shiftless , for all that -- no manager , as you might say .
Some folks would have been clear by now , but Osborne is one of those men that are bound to get behind .
He hasn't got any business faculty . ''
`` He isn't shiftless , '' said Nan quickly , `` and it isn't his fault if he has got behind .
It's all because of his care for his aunt .
He has had to spend more on her doctor's bills than would have raised the mortgage .
And now that she is dead and he might have a chance to pull up , you go and foreclose . ''
`` A man must look out for Number One , '' said Bryan easily , admiring Nan's downcast eyes and rosy cheeks .
`` I haven't any spite against Osborne , but business is business , you know . ''
Nan opened her lips to say something but , remembering Osborne's parting injunction , she shut them again .
She shot a scornful glance at Lee as he stood with his arms folded on the sill beside her .
Bryan lingered , talking small talk , until Nan announced that she must see about getting tea .
`` And you won't tell me who is going to take you to the picnic ? ''
he coaxed .
`` Oh , it's Ned Bennett , '' said Nan indifferently .
Bryan felt relieved .
He unpinned the huge cluster of violets on his coat and laid them down on the sill beside her before he went .
Nan flicked them off with her fingers as she watched him cross the lawn , his own self-satisfied smile upon his face .
* * * * * A week later the Osborne homestead had passed into Bryan Lee's hands and John Osborne was staying with his cousin at Thornhope , pending his departure for the west .
He had never been to see Nan since that last afternoon , but Bryan Lee haunted the Stewart place .
One day he suddenly stopped coming and , although Nan was discreetly silent , in due time it came to old Abe's ears by various driblets of gossip that Nan had refused him .
Old Abe marched straightway home to Nan in a fury and demanded if this were true .
Nan curtly admitted that it was .
Old Abe was so much taken aback by her coolness that he asked almost meekly what was her reason for doing such a fool trick .
`` Because he turned John Osborne out of house and home , '' returned Nan composedly .
`` If he hadn't done that there is no telling what might have happened .
I might even have married him , because I liked him very well and it would have pleased you .
At any rate , I wouldn't have married John when you were against him .
Now I mean to . ''
Old Abe stormed furiously at this , but Nan kept so provokingly cool that he was conscious of wasting breath .
He went off in a rage , but Nan did not feel particularly anxious now that the announcement was over .
He would cool down , she knew .
John Osborne worried her more .
She didn't see clearly how she was to marry him unless he asked her , and he had studiously avoided her since the foreclosure .
But Nan did not mean to be baffled or to let her lover slip through her fingers for want of a little courage .
She was not old Abe Stewart's daughter for nothing .
One day Ned Bennett dropped in and said that John Osborne would start for the west in three days .
That evening Nan went up to her room and dressed herself in the prettiest dress she owned , combed her hair around her sparkling face in bewitching curls , pinned a cluster of apple blossoms at her belt , and , thus equipped , marched down in the golden sunset light to the Mill Creek Bridge .
John Osborne , on his return from Thornhope half an hour later , found her there , leaning over the rail among the willows .
Nan started in well-assumed surprise and then asked him why he had not been to see her .
John blushed -- stammered -- didn't know -- had been busy .
Nan cut short his halting excuses by demanding to know if he were really going away , and what he intended to do .
`` I'll go out on the prairies and take up a claim , '' said Osborne sturdily .
`` Begin life over again free of debt .
It'll be hard work , but I 'm not afraid of that .
I will succeed if it takes me years . ''
They walked on in silence .
Nan came to the conclusion that Osborne meant to hold his peace .
`` John , '' she said tremulously , `` won't -- won't you find it very lonely out there ? ''
`` Of course -- I expect that .
I shall have to get used to it . ''
Nan grew nervous .
Proposing to a man was really very dreadful .
`` Wouldn't it be -- nicer for you '' -- she faltered -- `` that is -- it wouldn't be so lonely for you -- would it -- if -- if you had me out there with you ? ''
John Osborne stopped squarely in the dusty road and looked at her .
`` Nan ! ''
he exclaimed .
`` Oh , if you can't take a hint ! ''
said Nan in despair .
It was all of an hour later that a man drove past them as they loitered up the hill road in the twilight .
It was Bryan Lee ; he had taken from Osborne his house and land , but he had not been able to take Nan Stewart , after all .
