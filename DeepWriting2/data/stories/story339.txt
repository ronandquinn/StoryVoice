Natty Miller strolled down to the wharf where Bliss Ford was tying up the Cockawee .
Bliss was scowling darkly at the boat , a trim new one , painted white , whose furled sails seemed unaccountably wet and whose glistening interior likewise dripped with moisture .
A group of fishermen on the wharf were shaking their heads sagely as Natty drew near .
`` Might as well split her up for kindlings , Bliss , '' said Jake McLaren .
`` You'll never get men to sail in her .
It passed the first time , seeing as only young Johnson was skipper , but when a boat turns turtle with Captain Frank in command , there's something serious wrong with her . ''
`` What's up ? ''
asked Natty .
`` The Cockawee upset out in the bay again this morning , '' answered Will Scott .
`` That's the second time .
The Grey Gull picked up the men and towed her in .
It's no use trying to sail her .
Lobstermen ain't going to risk their lives in a boat like that .
How's things over at Blue Point , Natty ? ''
`` Pretty well , '' responded Natty laconically .
Natty never wasted words .
He had not talked a great deal in his fourteen years of life , but he was much given to thinking .
He was rather undersized and insignificant looking , but there were a few boys of his own age on the mainland who knew that Natty had muscles .
`` Has Everett heard anything from Ottawa about the lighthouse business yet ? ''
asked Will .
Natty shook his head .
`` Think he's any chance of getting the app ` intment ? ''
queried Adam Lewis .
`` Not the ghost of a chance , '' said Cooper Creasy decidedly .
`` He's on the wrong side of politics , that's what .
Er rather his father was .
A Tory's son ain't going to get an app ` intment from a Lib ` ral government , that's what . ''
`` Mr. Barr says that Everett is too young to be trusted in such a responsible position , '' quoted Natty gravely .
Cooper shrugged his shoulders .
`` Mebbe -- mebbe .
Eighteen is kind of green , but everybody knows that Ev's been the real lighthouse keeper for two years , since your father took sick .
Irving Elliott wants that light -- has wanted it for years -- and he's a pretty strong pull at headquarters , that's what .
Barr owes him something for years of hard work at elections .
I ain't saying anything against Elliott , either .
He's a good man , but your father's son ought to have that light as sure as he won't get it , that's what . ''
`` Any of you going to take in the sports tomorrow down at Summerside ? ''
asked Will Scott , in order to switch Cooper away from politics , which were apt to excite him .
`` I 'm going , for one , '' said Adam .
`` There's to be a yacht race atween the Summerside and Charlottetown boat clubs .
Yes , I am going .
Give you a chance down to the station , Natty , if you want one . ''
Natty shook his head .
`` Not going , '' he said briefly .
`` You should celebrate Victoria Day , '' said Adam , patriotically . ''
` Twenty-fourth o ' May's the Queen's birthday , Ef we don't get a holiday we'll all run away , ' as we used to say at school .
The good old Queen is dead , but the day's been app ` inted a national holiday in honour of her memory and you should celebrate it becoming , Natty-boy . ''
`` Ev and I can't both go , and he's going , '' explained Natty .
`` Prue and I'll stay home to light up .
Must be getting back now .
Looks squally . ''
`` I misdoubt if we'll have Queen's weather tomorrow , '' said Cooper , squinting critically at the sky .
`` Looks like a northeast blow , that's what .
There goes Bliss , striding off and looking pretty mad .
The Cockawee's a dead loss to him , that's what .
Nat's off -- he knows how to handle a boat middling well , too .
Pity he's such a puny youngster .
Not much to him , I reckon . ''
Natty had cast loose in his boat , the Merry Maid , and hoisted his sail .
In a few minutes he was skimming gaily down the bay .
The wind was fair and piping and the Merry Maid went like a bird .
Natty , at the rudder , steered for Blue Point Island , a reflective frown on his face .
He was feeling in no mood for Victoria Day sports .
In a very short time he and Ev and Prue must leave Blue Point lighthouse , where they had lived all their lives .
To Natty it seemed as if the end of all things would come then .
Where would life be worth living away from lonely , windy Blue Point Island ?
David Miller had died the preceding winter after a long illness .
He had been lighthouse keeper at Blue Point for thirty years .
His three children had been born and brought up there , and there , four years ago , the mother had died .
But womanly little Prue had taken her place well , and the boys were devoted to their sister .
When their father died , Everett had applied for the position of lighthouse keeper .
The matter was not yet publicly decided , but old Cooper Creasy had sized the situation up accurately .
The Millers had no real hope that Everett would be appointed .
Victoria Day , while not absolutely stormy , proved to be rather unpleasant .
A choppy northeast wind blew up the bay , and the water was rough enough .
The sky was overcast with clouds , and the May air was raw and chilly .
At Blue Point the Millers were early astir , for if Everett wanted to sail over to the mainland in time to catch the excursion train , no morning naps were permissible .
He was going alone .
Since only one of the boys could go , Natty had insisted that it should be Everett , and Prue had elected to stay home with Natty .
Prue had small heart for Victoria Day that year .
She did not feel even a thrill of enthusiasm when Natty hoisted a flag and wreathed the Queen's picture with creeping spruce .
Prue felt as badly about leaving Blue Point Island as the boys did .
The day passed slowly .
In the afternoon the wind fell away to a dead calm , but there was still a heavy swell on , and shortly before sunset a fog came creeping up from the east and spread over the bay and islands , so thick and white that Prue and Natty could not even see Little Bear Island on the right .
`` I 'm glad Everett isn't coming back tonight , '' said Prue .
`` He could never find his way cross the harbour in that fog . ''
`` Isn't it thick , though , '' said Natty .
`` The light won't show far tonight . ''
At sunset they lighted the great lamps and then settled down to an evening of reading .
But it was not long before Natty looked up from his book to say , `` Hello , Prue , what was that ?
Thought I heard a noise . ''
`` So did I , '' said Prue .
`` I sounded like someone calling . ''
They hurried to the door , which looked out on the harbour .
The night , owing to the fog , was dark with a darkness that seemed almost tangible .
From somewhere out of that darkness came a muffled shouting , like that of a person in distress .
`` Prue , there's somebody in trouble out there ! ''
exclaimed Natty .
`` Oh , it's surely never Ev ! ''
cried Prue .
Natty shook his head .
`` Don't think so .
Ev had no intention of coming back tonight .
Get that lantern , Prue .
I must go and see what and who it is . ''
`` Oh , Natty , you mustn't , '' cried Prue in distress .
`` There's a heavy swell on yet -- and the fog -- oh , if you get lost -- '' `` I'll not get lost , and I must go , Prue .
Maybe somebody is drowning out there .
It's not Ev , of course , but suppose it were !
That's a good girl . ''
Prue , with set face , had brought the lantern , resolutely choking back the words of fear and protest that rushed to her lips .
They hurried down to the shore and Natty sprang into the little skiff he used for rowing .
He hastily lashed the lantern in the stern , cast loose the painter , and lifted the oars .
`` I'll be back as soon as possible , '' he called to Prue .
`` Wait here for me . ''
In a minute the shore was out of sight , and Natty found himself alone in the black fog , with no guide but the cries for help , which already were becoming fainter .
They seemed to come from the direction of Little Bear , and thither Natty rowed .
It was a tough pull , and the water was rough enough for the little dory .
But Natty had been at home with the oars from babyhood , and his long training and tough sinews stood him in good stead now .
Steadily and intrepidly he rowed along .
The water grew rougher as he passed out from the shelter of Blue Point into the channel between the latter and Little Bear .
The cries were becoming very faint .
What if he should be too late ?
He bent to the oars with all his energy .
Presently , by the smoother water , he knew he must be in the lea of Little Bear .
The cries sounded nearer .
He must already have rowed nearly a mile .
The next minute he shot around a small headland and right before him , dimly visible in the faint light cast by the lantern through the fog , was an upturned boat with two men clinging to it , one on each side , evidently almost exhausted .
Natty rowed cautiously up to the one nearest him , knowing that he must be wary lest the grip of the drowning man overturn his own light skiff .
`` Let go when I say , '' he shouted , `` and don't -- grab -- anything , do you hear ?
Don't -- grab .
Now , let go . ''
The next minute the man lay in the dory , dragged over the stern by Netty's grip on his collar .
`` Lie still , '' ordered Natty , clutching the oars .
To row around the overturned boat , amid the swirl of water about her , was a task that taxed Netty's skill and strength to the utmost .
The other man was dragged in over the bow , and with a gasp of relief Natty pulled away from the sinking boat .
Once clear of her he could not row for a few minutes ; he was shaking from head to foot with the reaction from tremendous effort and strain .
`` This'll never do , '' he muttered .
`` I 'm not going to be a baby now .
But will I ever be able to row back ? ''
Presently , however , he was able to grip his oars again and pull for the lighthouse , whose beacon loomed dimly through the fog like a great blur of whiter mist .
The men , obedient to his orders , lay quietly where he had placed them , and before long Natty was back again at the lighthouse landing , where Prue was waiting , wild with anxiety .
The men were helped out and assisted up to the lighthouse , where Natty went to hunt up dry clothes for them , and Prue flew about to prepare hot drinks .
`` To think that that child saved us ! ''
exclaimed one of the men .
`` Why , I didn't think a grown man had the strength to do what he did .
He is your brother , I suppose , Miss Miller .
You have another brother , I think ? ''
`` Oh , yes -- Everett -- but he is away , '' explained Prue .
`` We heard your shouts and Natty insisted on going at once to your rescue . ''
`` Well , he came just in time .
I couldn't have held on another minute -- was so done up I couldn't have moved or spoken all the way here even if he hadn't commanded me to keep perfectly still . ''
Natty returned at this moment and exclaimed , `` Why , it is Mr. Barr .
I didn't recognize you before . ''
`` Barr it is , young man .
This gentleman is my friend , Mr. Blackmore .
We have been celebrating Victoria Day by a shooting tramp over Little Bear .
We hired a boat from Ford at the Harbour Head this morning -- the Cockawee , he called her -- and sailed over .
I don't know much about running a boat , but Blackmore here thinks he does .
We were at the other side of the island when the fog came up .
We hurried across it , but it was almost dark when we reached our boat .
We sailed around the point and then the boat just simply upset -- don't know why -- '' `` But I know why , '' interrupted Natty indignantly .
`` That Cockawee does nothing but upset .
She has turned turtle twice out in the harbour in fine weather .
Ford was a rascal to let her to you .
He might have known what would happen .
Why -- why -- it was almost murder to let you go ! ''
`` I thought there must be something queer about her , '' declared Mr. Blackmore .
`` I do know how to handle a boat despite my friend's gibe , and there was no reason why she should have upset like that .
That Ford ought to be horsewhipped . ''
Thanks to Prue's stinging hot decoctions of black currant drink , the two gentlemen were no worse for their drenching and exposure , and the next morning Natty took them to the mainland in the Merry Maid .
When he parted with them , Mr. Barr shook his hand heartily and said : `` Thank you , my boy .
You 're a plucky youngster and a skilful one , too .
Tell your brother that if I can get the Blue Point lighthouse berth for him I will , and as for yourself , you will always find a friend in me , and if I can ever do anything for you I will . ''
Two weeks later Everett received an official document formally appointing him keeper of Blue Point Island light .
Natty carried the news to the mainland , where it was joyfully received among the fishermen .
`` Only right and fair , '' said Cooper Creasy .
`` Blue Point without a Miller to light up wouldn't seem the thing at all , that's what .
And it's nothing but Ev's doo . ''
`` Guess Natty had more to do with it than Ev , '' said Adam , perpetrating a very poor pun and being immensely applauded therefor .
It keyed Will Scott up to rival Adam .
`` You said that Irving had a pull and the Millers hadn't , '' he said jocularly .
`` But it looks as if 't was Natty's pull did the business after all -- his pull over to Bear Island and back . ''
`` It was about a miracle that a boy could do what he did on such a night , '' said Charles Macey .
`` Where's Ford ? ''
asked Natty uncomfortably .
He hated to have his exploit talked about .
`` Ford has cleared out , '' said Cooper , `` gone down to Summerside to go into Tobe Meekins's factory there .
Best thing he could do , that's what .
Folks here hadn't no use for him after letting that death trap to them two men -- even if they was Lib ` rals .
The Cockawee druv ashore on Little Bear , and there she's going to remain , I guess .
D'ye want a berth in my mackerel boat this summer , Natty ? ''
`` I do , '' said Natty , `` but I thought you said you were full . ''
`` I guess I can make room for you , '' said Cooper .
`` A boy with such grit and muscle ain't to be allowed to go to seed on Blue Point , that's what .
Yesser , we'll make room for you . ''
And Natty's cup of happiness was full .
