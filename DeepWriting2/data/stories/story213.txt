Once upon a time what should happen DID happen ; and if it had not happened this tale would never have been told .
There was once an emperor , very great and mighty , and he ruled over an empire so large that no one knew where it began and where it ended .
But if nobody could tell the exact extent of his sovereignty everybody was aware that the emperor's right eye laughed , while his left eye wept .
One or two men of valour had the courage to go and ask him the reason of this strange fact , but he only laughed and said nothing ; and the reason of the deadly enmity between his two eyes was a secret only known to the monarch himself .
And all the while the emperor's sons were growing up .
And such sons !
All three like the morning stars in the sky !
Florea , the eldest , was so tall and broad-shouldered that no man in the kingdom could approach him .
Costan , the second , was quite different .
Small of stature , and slightly built , he had a strong arm and stronger wrist .
Petru , the third and youngest , was tall and thin , more like a girl than a boy .
He spoke very little , but laughed and sang , sang and laughed , from morning till night .
He was very seldom serious , but then he had a way when he was thinking of stroking his hair over his forehead , which made him look old enough to sit in his father's council !
` You are grown up , Florea , ' said Petru one day to his eldest brother ; ` do go and ask father why one eye laughs and the other weeps . '
But Florea would not go .
He had learnt by experience that this question always put the emperor in a rage .
Petru next went to Costan , but did not succeed any better with him .
` Well , well , as everyone else is afraid , I suppose I must do it myself , ' observed Petru at length .
No sooner said than done ; the boy went straight to his father and put his question .
` May you go blind ! '
exclaimed the emperor in wrath ; ` what business is it of yours ? '
and boxed Petru's ears soundly .
Petru returned to his brothers , and told them what had befallen him ; but not long after it struck him that his father's left eye seemed to weep less , and the right to laugh more . '
I wonder if it has anything to do with my question , ' thought he .
` I'll try again !
After all , what do two boxes on the ear matter ? '
So he put his question for the second time , and had the same answer ; but the left eye only wept now and then , while the right eye looked ten years younger .
` It really MUST be true , ' thought Petru .
` Now I know what I have to do .
I shall have to go on putting that question , and getting boxes on the ear , till both eyes laugh together . '
No sooner said than done .
Petru never , never forswore himself .
` Petru , my dear boy , ' cried the emperor , both his eyes laughing together , ' I see you have got this on the brain .
Well , I will let you into the secret .
My right eye laughs when I look at my three sons , and see how strong and handsome you all are , and the other eye weeps because I fear that after I die you will not be able to keep the empire together , and to protect it from its enemies .
But if you can bring me water from the spring of the Fairy of the Dawn , to bathe my eyes , then they will laugh for evermore ; for I shall know that my sons are brave enough to overcome any foe . '
Thus spoke the emperor , and Petru picked up his hat and went to find his brothers .
The three young men took counsel together , and talked the subject well over , as brothers should do .
And the end of it was that Florea , as the eldest , went to the stables , chose the best and handsomest horse they contained , saddled him , and took leave of the court . '
I am starting at once , ' said he to his brothers , ` and if after a year , a month , a week , and a day I have not returned with the water from the spring of the Fairy of the Dawn , you , Costan , had better come after me . '
So saying he disappeared round a corner of the palace .
For three days and three nights he never drew rein .
Like a spirit the horse flew over mountains and valleys till he came to the borders of the empire .
Here was a deep , deep trench that girdled it the whole way round , and there was only a single bridge by which the trench could be crossed .
Florea made instantly for the bridge , and there pulled up to look around him once more , to take leave of his native land Then he turned , but before him was standing a dragon -- oh !
SUCH a dragon !
-- a dragon with three heads and three horrible faces , all with their mouths wide open , one jaw reaching to heaven and the other to earth .
At this awful sight Florea did not wait to give battle .
He put spurs to his horse and dashed off , WHERE he neither knew nor cared .
The dragon heaved a sigh and vanished without leaving a trace behind him .
A week went by .
Florea did not return home .
Two passed ; and nothing was heard of him .
After a month Costan began to haunt the stables and to look out a horse for himself .
And the moment the year , the month , the week , and the day were over Costan mounted his horse and took leave of his youngest brother .
` If I fail , then you come , ' said he , and followed the path that Florea had taken .
The dragon on the bridge was more fearful and his three heads more terrible than before , and the young hero rode away still faster than his brother had done .
Nothing more was heard either of him or Florea ; and Petru remained alone . '
I must go after my brothers , ' said Petru one day to his father .
` Go , then , ' said his father , ` and may you have better luck than they ' ; and he bade farewell to Petru , who rode straight to the borders of the kingdom .
The dragon on the bridge was yet more dreadful than the one Florea and Costan had seen , for this one had seven heads instead of only three .
Petru stopped for a moment when he caught sight of this terrible creature .
Then he found his voice .
` Get out of the way ! '
cried he .
` Get out of the way ! '
he repeated again , as the dragon did not move .
` Get out of the way ! '
and with this last summons he drew his sword and rushed upon him .
In an instant the heavens seemed to darken round him and he was surrounded by fire -- fire to right of him , fire to left of him , fire to front of him , fire to rear of him ; nothing but fire whichever way he looked , for the dragon's seven heads were vomiting flame .
The horse neighed and reared at the horrible sight , and Petru could not use the sword he had in readiness .
` Be quiet !
this won't do ! '
he said , dismounting hastily , but holding the bridle firmly in his left hand and grasping his sword in his right .
But even so he got on no better , for he could see nothing but fire and smoke .
` There is no help for it ; I must go back and get a better horse , ' said he , and mounted again and rode homewards .
At the gate of the palace his nurse , old Birscha , was waiting for him eagerly .
` Ah , Petru , my son , I knew you would have to come back , ' she cried .
` You did not set about the matter properly . '
` How ought I to have set about it ? '
asked Petru , half angrily , half sadly .
` Look here , my boy , ' replied old Birscha .
` You can never reach the spring of the Fairy of the Dawn unless you ride the horse which your father , the emperor , rode in his youth .
Go and ask where it is to be found , and then mount it and be off with you . '
Petru thanked her heartily for her advice , and went at once to make inquiries about the horse .
` By the light of my eyes ! '
exclaimed the emperor when Petru had put his question .
` Who has told you anything about that ?
It must have been that old witch of a Birscha ?
Have you lost your wits ?
Fifty years have passed since I was young , and who knows where the bones of my horse may be rotting , or whether a scrap of his reins still lie in his stall ?
I have forgotten all about him long ago . '
Petru turned away in anger , and went back to his old nurse .
` Do not be cast down , ' she said with a smile ; ` if that is how the affair stands all will go well .
Go and fetch the scrap of the reins ; I shall soon know what must be done . '
The place was full of saddles , bridles , and bits of leather .
Petru picked out the oldest , and blackest , and most decayed pair of reins , and brought them to the old woman , who murmured something over them and sprinkled them with incense , and held them out to the young man .
` Take the reins , ' said she , ` and strike them violently against the pillars of the house . '
Petru did what he was told , and scarcely had the reins touched the pillars when something happened -- HOW I have no idea -- that made Petru stare with surprise .
A horse stood before him -- a horse whose equal in beauty the world had never seen ; with a saddle on him of gold and precious stones , and with such a dazzling bridle you hardly dared to look at it , lest you should lose your sight .
A splendid horse , a splendid saddle , and a splendid bridle , all ready for the splendid young prince !
` Jump on the back of the brown horse , ' said the old woman , and she turned round and went into the house .
The moment Petru was seated on the horse he felt his arm three times as strong as before , and even his heart felt braver .
` Sit firmly in the saddle , my lord , for we have a long way to go and no time to waste , ' said the brown horse , and Petru soon saw that they were riding as no man and horse had ever ridden before .
On the bridge stood a dragon , but not the same one as he had tried to fight with , for this dragon had twelve heads , each more hideous and shooting forth more terrible flames than the other .
But , horrible though he was , he had met his match .
Petru showed no fear , but rolled up his sleeves , that his arms might be free .
` Get out of the way ! '
he said when he had done , but the dragon's heads only breathed forth more flames and smoke .
Petru wasted no more words , but drew his sword and prepared to throw himself on the bridge .
` Stop a moment ; be careful , my lord , ' put in the horse , ` and be sure you do what I tell you .
Dig your spurs in my body up to the rowel , draw your sword , and keep yourself ready , for we shall have to leap over both bridge and dragon .
When you see that we are right above the dragon cut off his biggest head , wipe the blood off the sword , and put it back clean in the sheath before we touch earth again . '
So Petru dug in his spurs , drew his sword , cut of the head , wiped the blood , and put the sword back in the sheath before the horse's hoofs touched the ground again .
And in this fashion they passed the bridge .
` But we have got to go further still , ' said Petru , after he had taken a farewell glance at his native land .
` Yes , forwards , ' answered the horse ; ` but you must tell me , my lord , at what speed you wish to go .
Like the wind ?
Like thought ?
Like desire ?
or like a curse ? '
Petru looked about him , up at the heavens and down again to the earth .
A desert lay spread out before him , whose aspect made his hair stand on end .
` We will ride at different speeds , ' said he , ` not so fast as to grow tired nor so slow as to waste time . '
And so they rode , one day like the wind , the next like thought , the third and fourth like desire and like a curse , till they reached the borders of the desert .
` Now walk , so that I may look about , and see what I have never seen before , ' said Petru , rubbing his eyes like one who wakes from sleep , or like him who beholds something so strange that it seems as if ... Before Petru lay a wood made of copper , with copper trees and copper leaves , with bushes and flowers of copper also .
Petru stood and stared as a man does when he sees something that he has never seen , and of which he has never heard .
Then he rode right into the wood .
On each side of the way the rows of flowers began to praise Petru , and to try and persuade him to pick some of them and make himself a wreath .
` Take me , for I am lovely , and can give strength to whoever plucks me , ' said one .
` No , take me , for whoever wears me in his hat will be loved by the most beautiful woman in the world , ' pleaded the second ; and then one after another bestirred itself , each more charming than the last , all promising , in soft sweet voices , wonderful things to Petru , if only he would pick them .
Petru was not deaf to their persuasion , and was just stooping to pick one when the horse sprang to one side .
` Why don't you stay still ? '
asked Petru roughly .
` Do not pick the flowers ; it will bring you bad luck ; answered the horse .
` Why should it do that ? '
` These flowers are under a curse .
Whoever plucks them must fight the Welwa , 1 , of the woods . '
, 1 , A goblin .
` What kind of a goblin is the Welwa ? '
` Oh , do leave me in peace !
But listen .
Look at the flowers as much as you like , but pick none , ' and the horse walked on slowly .
Petru knew by experience that he would do well to attend to the horse's advice , so he made a great effort and tore his mind away from the flowers .
But in vain !
If a man is fated to be unlucky , unlucky he will be , whatever he may do !
The flowers went on beseeching him , and his heart grew ever weaker and weaker .
` What must come will come , ' said Petru at length ; ` at any rate I shall see the Welwa of the woods , what she is like , and which way I had best fight her .
If she is ordained to be the cause of my death , well , then it will be so ; but if not I shall conquer her though she were twelve hundred Welwas , ' and once more he stooped down to gather the flowers .
` You have done very wrong , ' said the horse sadly .
` But it can't be helped now .
Get yourself ready for battle , for here is the Welwa ! '
Hardly had he done speaking , scarcely had Petru twisted his wreath , when a soft breeze arose on all sides at once .
Out of the breeze came a storm wind , and the storm wind swelled and swelled till everything around was blotted out in darkness , and darkness covered them as with a thick cloak , while the earth swayed and shook under their feet .
` Are you afraid ? '
asked the horse , shaking his mane .
` Not yet , ' replied Petru stoutly , though cold shivers were running down his back .
` What must come will come , whatever it is . '
` Don't be afraid , ' said the horse . '
I will help you .
Take the bridle from my neck , and try to catch the Welwa with it . '
The words were hardly spoken , and Petru had no time even to unbuckle the bridle , when the Welwa herself stood before him ; and Petru could not bear to look at her , so horrible was she .
She had not exactly a head , yet neither was she without one .
She did not fly through the air , but neither did she walk upon the earth .
She had a mane like a horse , horns like a deer , a face like a bear , eyes like a polecat ; while her body had something of each .
And that was the Welwa .
Petru planted himself firmly in his stirrups , and began to lay about him with his sword , but could feel nothing .
A day and a night went by , and the fight was still undecided , but at last the Welwa began to pant for breath .
` Let us wait a little and rest , ' gasped she .
Petru stopped and lowered his sword .
` You must not stop an instant , ' said the horse , and Petru gathered up all his strength , and laid about him harder than ever .
The Welwa gave a neigh like a horse and a howl like a wolf , and threw herself afresh on Petru .
For another day and night the battle raged more furiously than before .
And Petru grew so exhausted he could scarcely move his arm .
` Let us wait a little and rest , ' cried the Welwa for the second time , ` for I see you are as weary as I am . '
` You must not stop an instant , ' said the horse .
And Petru went on fighting , though he barely had strength to move his arm .
But the Welwa had ceased to throw herself upon him , and began to deliver her blows cautiously , as if she had no longer power to strike .
And on the third day they were still fighting , but as the morning sky began to redden Petru somehow managed -- how I can not tell -- to throw the bridle over the head of the tired Welwa .
In a moment , from the Welwa sprang a horse -- the most beautiful horse in the world .
` Sweet be your life , for you have delivered me from my enchantment , ' said he , and began to rub his nose against his brother's .
And he told Petru all his story , and how he had been bewitched for many years .
So Petru tied the Welwa to his own horse and rode on .
Where did he ride ?
That I can not tell you , but he rode on fast till he got out of the copper wood .
` Stay still , and let me look about , and see what I never have seen before , ' said Petru again to his horse .
For in front of him stretched a forest that was far more wonderful , as it was made of glistening trees and shining flowers .
It was the silver wood .
As before , the flowers began to beg the young man to gather them .
` Do not pluck them , ' warned the Welwa , trotting beside him , ` for my brother is seven times stronger than I ' ; but though Petru knew by experience what this meant , it was no use , and after a moment's hesitation he began to gather the flowers , and to twist himself a wreath .
Then the storm wind howled louder , the earth trembled more violently , and the night grew darker , than the first time , and the Welwa of the silver wood came rushing on with seven times the speed of the other .
For three days and three nights they fought , but at last Petru cast the bridle over the head of the second Welwa .
` Sweet be your life , for you have delivered me from enchantment , ' said the second Welwa , and they all journeyed on as before .
But soon they came to a gold wood more lovely far than the other two , and again Petru's companions pleaded with him to ride through it quickly , and to leave the flowers alone .
But Petru turned a deaf ear to all they said , and before he had woven his golden crown he felt that something terrible , that he could not see , was coming near him right out of the earth .
He drew his sword and made himself ready for the fight . '
I will die ! '
cried he , ` or he shall have my bridle over his head . '
He had hardly said the words when a thick fog wrapped itself around him , and so thick was it that he could not see his own hand , or hear the sound of his voice .
For a day and a night he fought with his sword , without ever once seeing his enemy , then suddenly the fog began to lighten .
By dawn of the second day it had vanished altogether , and the sun shone brightly in the heavens .
It seemed to Petru that he had been born again .
And the Welwa ?
She had vanished .
` You had better take breath now you can , for the fight will have to begin all over again , ' said the horse .
` What was it ? '
asked Petru .
` It was the Welwa , ' replied the horse , ` changed into a fog ` Listen !
She is coming ! '
And Petru had hardly drawn a long breath when he felt something approaching from the side , though what he could not tell .
A river , yet not a river , for it seemed not to flow over the earth , but to go where it liked , and to leave no trace of its passage .
` Woe be to me ! '
cried Petru , frightened at last .
` Beware , and never stand still , ' called the brown horse , and more he could not say , for the water was choking him .
The battle began anew .
For a day and a night Petru fought on , without knowing at whom or what he struck .
At dawn on the second , he felt that both his feet were lame .
` Now I am done for , ' thought he , and his blows fell thicker and harder in his desperation .
And the sun came out and the water disappeared , without his knowing how or when .
` Take breath , ' said the horse , ` for you have no time to lose .
The Welwa will return in a moment . '
Petru made no reply , only wondered how , exhausted as he was , he should ever be able to carry on the fight .
But he settled himself in his saddle , grasped his sword , and waited .
And then something came to him -- WHAT I can not tell you .
Perhaps , in his dreams , a man may see a creature which has what it has not got , and has not got what it has .
At least , that was what the Welwa seemed like to Petru .
She flew with her feet , and walked with her wings ; her head was in her back , and her tail was on top of her body ; her eyes were in her neck , and her neck in her forehead , and how to describe her further I do not know .
Petru felt for a moment as if he was wrapped in a garment of fear ; then he shook himself and took heart , and fought as he had never yet fought before .
As the day wore on , his strength began to fail , and when darkness fell he could hardly keep his eyes open .
By midnight he knew he was no longer on his horse , but standing on the ground , though he could not have told how he got there .
When the grey light of morning came , he was past standing on his feet , but fought now upon his knees .
` Make one more struggle ; it is nearly over now , ' said the horse , seeing that Petru's strength was waning fast .
Petru wiped the sweat from his brow with his gauntlet , and with a desperate effort rose to his feet .
` Strike the Welwa on the mouth with the bridle , ' said the horse , and Petru did it .
The Welwa uttered a neigh so loud that Petru thought he would be deaf for life , and then , though she too was nearly spent , flung herself upon her enemy ; but Petru was on the watch and threw the bridle over her head , as she rushed on , so that when the day broke there were three horses trotting beside him .
` May your wife be the most beautiful of women , ' said the Welwa , ` for you have delivered me from my enchantment . '
So the four horses galloped fast , and by nightfall they were at the borders of the golden forest .
Then Petru began to think of the crowns that he wore , and what they had cost him .
` After all , what do I want with so many ?
I will keep the best , ' he said to himself ; and taking off first the copper crown and then the silver , he threw them away .
` Stay ! '
cried the horse , ` do not throw them away !
Perhaps we shall find them of use .
Get down and pick them up . '
So Petru got down and picked them up , and they all went on .
In the evening , when the sun is getting low , and all the midges are beginning to bite , Peter saw a wide heath stretching before him .
At the same instant the horse stood still of itself .
` What is the matter ? '
asked Petru . '
I am afraid that something evil will happen to us , ' answered the horse .
` But why should it ? '
` We are going to enter the kingdom of the goddess Mittwoch , 2 , and the further we ride into it the colder we shall get .
But all along the road there are huge fires , and I dread lest you should stop and warm yourself at them . '
, 2 , In German ` Mittwoch , ' the feminine form of Mercury .
` And why should I not warm myself ? '
` Something fearful will happen to you if you do , ' replied the horse sadly .
` Well , forward ! '
cried Petru lightly , ` and if I have to bear cold , I must bear it ! '
With every step they went into the kingdom of Mittwoch , the air grew colder and more icy , till even the marrow in their bones was frozen .
But Petru was no coward ; the fight he had gone through had strengthened his powers of endurance , and he stood the test bravely .
Along the road on each side were great fires , with men standing by them , who spoke pleasantly to Petru as he went by , and invited him to join them .
The breath froze in his mouth , but he took no notice , only bade his horse ride on the faster .
How long Petru may have waged battle silently with the cold one can not tell , for everybody knows that the kingdom of Mittwoch is not to be crossed in a day , but he struggled on , though the frozen rocks burst around , and though his teeth chattered , and even his eyelids were frozen .
At length they reached the dwelling of Mittwoch herself , and , jumping from his horse , Petru threw the reins over his horse's neck and entered the hut .
` Good-day , little mother ! '
said he .
` Very well , thank you , my frozen friend ! '
Petru laughed , and waited for her to speak .
` You have borne yourself bravely , ' went on the goddess , tapping him on the shoulder .
` Now you shall have your reward , ' and she opened an iron chest , out of which she took a little box .
` Look ! '
said she ; ` this little box has been lying here for ages , waiting for the man who could win his way through the Ice Kingdom .
Take it , and treasure it , for some day it may help you .
If you open it , it will tell you anything you want , and give you news of your fatherland . '
Petru thanked her gratefully for her gift , mounted his horse , and rode away .
When he was some distance from the hut , he opened the casket .
` What are your commands ? '
asked a voice inside .
` Give me news of my father , ' he replied , rather nervously .
` He is sitting in council with his nobles , ' answered the casket .
` Is he well ? '
` Not particularly , for he is furiously angry . '
` What has angered him ? '
` Your brothers Costan and Florea , ' replied the casket .
` It seems to me they are trying to rule him and the kingdom as well , and the old man says they are not fit to do it . '
` Push on , good horse , for we have no time to lose ! '
cried Petru ; then he shut up the box , and put it in his pocket .
They rushed on as fast as ghosts , as whirlwinds , as vampires when they hunt at midnight , and how long they rode no man can tell , for the way is far .
` Stop !
I have some advice to give you , ' said the horse at last .
` What is it ? '
asked Petru .
` You have known what it is to suffer cold ; you will have to endure heat , such as you have never dreamed of .
Be as brave now as you were then .
Let no one tempt you to try to cool yourself , or evil will befall you . '
` Forwards ! '
answered Petru .
` Do not worry yourself .
If I have escaped without being frozen , there is no chance of my melting . '
` Why not ?
This is a heat that will melt the marrow in your bones -- a heat that is only to be felt in the kingdom of the Goddess of Thunder . '
And it WAS hot .
The very iron of the horse's shoes began to melt , but Petru gave no heed .
The sweat ran down his face , but he dried it with his gauntlet .
What heat could be he never knew before , and on the way , not a stone's throw from the road , lay the most delicious valleys , full of shady trees and bubbling streams .
When Petru looked at them his heart burned within him , and his mouth grew parched .
And standing among the flowers were lovely maidens who called to him in soft voices , till he had to shut his eyes against their spells .
` Come , my hero , come and rest ; the heat will kill you , ' said they .
Petru shook his head and said nothing , for he had lost the power of speech .
Long he rode in this awful state , how long none can tell .
Suddenly the heat seemed to become less , and , in the distance , he saw a little hut on a hill .
This was the dwelling of the Goddess of Thunder , and when he drew rein at her door the goddess herself came out to meet him .
She welcomed him , and kindly invited him in , and bade him tell her all his adventures .
So Petru told her all that had happened to him , and why he was there , and then took farewell of her , as he had no time to lose .
` For , ' he said , ` who knows how far the Fairy of the Dawn may yet be ? '
` Stay for one moment , for I have a word of advice to give you .
You are about to enter the kingdom of Venus ; , 4 , go and tell her , as a message from me , that I hope she will not tempt you to delay .
On your way back , come to me again , and I will give you something that may be of use to you . '
, 4 , ` Vineri ' is Friday , and also ` Venus . '
So Petru mounted his horse , and had hardly ridden three steps when he found himself in a new country .
Here it was neither hot nor cold , but the air was warm and soft like spring , though the way ran through a heath covered with sand and thistles .
` What can that be ? '
asked Petru , when he saw a long , long way off , at the very end of the heath , something resembling a house .
` That is the house of the goddess Venus , ' replied the horse , ` and if we ride hard we may reach it before dark ' ; and he darted off like an arrow , so that as twilight fell they found themselves nearing the house .
Petru's heart leaped at the sight , for all the way along he had been followed by a crowd of shadowy figures who danced about him from right to left , and from back to front , and Petru , though a brave man , felt now and then a thrill of fear .
` They won't hurt you , ' said the horse ; ` they are just the daughters of the whirlwind amusing themselves while they are waiting for the ogre of the moon . '
Then he stopped in front of the house , and Petru jumped off and went to the door .
` Do not be in such a hurry , ' cried the horse .
` There are several things I must tell you first .
You can not enter the house of the goddess Venus like that .
She is always watched and guarded by the whirlwind . '
` What am I to do then ? '
` Take the copper wreath , and go with it to that little hill over there .
When you reach it , say to yourself , `` Were there ever such lovely maidens !
such angels !
such fairy souls ! ''
Then hold the wreath high in the air and cry , `` Oh !
if I knew whether any one would accept this wreath from me ... if I knew !
if I knew ! ''
and throw the wreath from you ! '
` And why should I do all this ? '
said Petru .
` Ask no questions , but go and do it , ' replied the horse .
And Petru did .
Scarcely had he flung away the copper wreath than the whirlwind flung himself upon it , and tore it in pieces .
Then Petru turned once more to the horse .
` Stop ! '
cried the horse again . '
I have other things to tell you .
Take the silver wreath and knock at the windows of the goddess Venus .
When she says , `` Who is there ? ''
answer that you have come on foot and lost your way on the heath .
She will then tell you to go your way back again ; but take care not to stir from the spot .
Instead , be sure you say to her , `` No , indeed I shall do nothing of the sort , as from my childhood I have heard stories of the beauty of the goddess Venus , and it was not for nothing that I had shoes made of leather with soles of steel , and have travelled for nine years and nine months , and have won in battle the silver wreath , which I hope you may allow me to give you , and have done and suffered everything to be where I now am . ''
This is what you must say .
What happens after is your affair . '
Petru asked no more , but went towards the house .
By this time it was pitch dark , and there was only the ray of light that streamed through the windows to guide him , and at the sound of his footsteps two dogs began to bark loudly .
` Which of those dogs is barking ?
Is he tired of life ? '
asked the goddess Venus .
` It is I , O goddess ! '
replied Petru , rather timidly . '
I have lost my way on the heath , and do not know where I am to sleep this night . '
` Where did you leave your horse ? '
asked the goddess sharply .
Petru did not answer .
He was not sure if he was to lie , or whether he had better tell the truth .
` Go away , my son , there is no place for you here , ' replied she , drawing back from the window .
Then Petru repeated hastily what the horse had told him to say , and no sooner had he done so than the goddess opened the window , and in gentle tones she asked him : ` Let me see this wreath , my son , ' and Petru held it out to her .
` Come into the house , ' went on the goddess ; ` do not fear the dogs , they always know my will . '
And so they did , for as the young man passed they wagged their tails to him .
` Good evening , ' said Petru as he entered the house , and , seating himself near the fire , listened comfortably to whatever the goddess might choose to talk about , which was for the most part the wickedness of men , with whom she was evidently very angry .
But Petru agreed with her in everything , as he had been taught was only polite .
But was anybody ever so old as she !
I do not know why Petru devoured her so with his eyes , unless it was to count the wrinkles on her face ; but if so he would have had to live seven lives , and each life seven times the length of an ordinary one , before he could have reckoned them up .
But Venus was joyful in her heart when she saw Petru's eyes fixed upon her .
` Nothing was that is , and the world was not a world when I was born , ' said she .
` When I grew up and the world came into being , everyone thought I was the most beautiful girl that ever was seen , though many hated me for it .
But every hundred years there came a wrinkle on my face .
And now I am old . '
Then she went on to tell Petru that she was the daughter of an emperor , and their nearest neighbour was the Fairy of the Dawn , with whom she had a violent quarrel , and with that she broke out into loud abuse of her .
Petru did not know what to do .
He listened in silence for the most part , but now and then he would say , ` Yes , yes , you must have been badly treated , ' just for politeness ' sake ; what more could he do ? '
I will give you a task to perform , for you are brave , and will carry it through , ' continued Venus , when she had talked a long time , and both of them were getting sleepy .
` Close to the Fairy's house is a well , and whoever drinks from it will blossom again like a rose .
Bring me a flagon of it , and I will do anything to prove my gratitude .
It is not easy !
no one knows that better than I do !
The kingdom is guarded on every side by wild beasts and horrible dragons ; but I will tell you more about that , and I also have something to give you . '
Then she rose and lifted the lid of an iron-bound chest , and took out of it a very tiny flute .
` Do you see this ? '
she asked .
` An old man gave it to me when I was young : whoever listens to this flute goes to sleep , and nothing can wake him .
Take it and play on it as long as you remain in the kingdom of the Fairy of the Dawn , and you will be safe .
At this , Petru told her that he had another task to fulfil at the well of the Fairy of the Dawn , and Venus was still better pleased when she heard his tale .
So Petru bade her good-night , put the flute in its case , and laid himself down in the lowest chamber to sleep .
Before the dawn he was awake again , and his first care was to give to each of his horses as much corn as he could eat , and then to lead them to the well to water .
Then he dressed himself and made ready to start .
` Stop , ' cried Venus from her window , ' I have still a piece of advice to give you .
Leave one of your horses here , and only take three .
Ride slowly till you get to the fairy's kingdom , then dismount and go on foot .
When you return , see that all your three horses remain on the road , while you walk .
But above all beware never to look the Fairy of the Dawn in the face , for she has eyes that will bewitch you , and glances that will befool you .
She is hideous , more hideous than anything you can imagine , with owl's eyes , foxy face , and cat's claws .
Do you hear ?
do you hear ?
Be sure you never look at her . '
Petru thanked her , and managed to get off at last .
Far , far away , where the heavens touch the earth , where the stars kiss the flowers , a soft red light was seen , such as the sky sometimes has in spring , only lovelier , more wonderful .
That light was behind the palace of the Fairy of the Dawn , and it took Petru two days and nights through flowery meadows to reach it .
And besides , it was neither hot nor cold , bright nor dark , but something of them all , and Petru did not find the way a step too long .
After some time Petru saw something white rise up out of the red of the sky , and when he drew nearer he saw it was a castle , and so splendid that his eyes were dazzled when they looked at it .
He did not know there was such a beautiful castle in the world .
But no time was to be lost , so he shook himself , jumped down from his horse , and , leaving him on the dewy grass , began to play on his flute as he walked along .
He had hardly gone many steps when he stumbled over a huge giant , who had been lulled to sleep by the music .
This was one of the guards of the castle !
As he lay there on his back , he seemed so big that in spite of Petru's haste he stopped to measure him .
The further went Petru , the more strange and terrible were the sights he saw -- lions , tigers , dragons with seven heads , all stretched out in the sun fast asleep .
It is needless to say what the dragons were like , for nowadays everyone knows , and dragons are not things to joke about .
Petru ran through them like the wind .
Was it haste or fear that spurred him on ?
At last he came to a river , but let nobody think for a moment that this river was like other rivers ?
Instead of water , there flowed milk , and the bottom was of precious stones and pearls , instead of sand and pebbles .
And it ran neither fast nor slow , but both fast and slow together .
And the river flowed round the castle , and on its banks slept lions with iron teeth and claws ; and beyond were gardens such as only the Fairy of the Dawn can have , and on the flowers slept a fairy !
All this saw Petru from the other side .
But how was he to get over ?
To be sure there was a bridge , but , even if it had not been guarded by sleeping lions , it was plainly not meant for man to walk on .
Who could tell what it was made of ?
It looked like soft little woolly clouds !
So he stood thinking what was to be done , for get across he must .
After a while , he determined to take the risk , and strode back to the sleeping giant .
` Wake up , my brave man ! '
he cried , giving him a shake .
The giant woke and stretched out his hand to pick up Petru , just as we should catch a fly .
But Petru played on his flute , and the giant fell back again .
Petru tried this three times , and when he was satisfied that the giant was really in his power he took out a handkerchief , bound the two little fingers of the giant together , drew his sword , and cried for the fourth time , ` Wake up , my brave man . '
When the giant saw the trick which had been played on him he said to Petru .
` Do you call this a fair fight ?
Fight according to rules , if you really are a hero ! ' '
I will by-and-by , but first I want to ask you a question !
Will you swear that you will carry me over the river if I fight honourably with you ? '
And the giant swore .
When his hands were freed , the giant flung himself upon Petru , hoping to crush him by his weight .
But he had met his match .
It was not yesterday , nor the day before , that Petru had fought his first battle , and he bore himself bravely .
For three days and three nights the battle raged , and sometimes one had the upper hand , and sometimes the other , till at length they both lay struggling on the ground , but Petru was on top , with the point of his sword at the giant's throat .
` Let me go !
let me go ! '
shrieked he . '
I own that I am beaten ! '
` Will you take me over the river ? '
asked Petru . '
I will , ' gasped the giant .
` What shall I do to you if you break your word ? '
` Kill me , any way you like !
But let me live now . '
` Very well , ' said Petru , and he bound the giant's left hand to his right foot , tied one handkerchief round his mouth to prevent him crying out , and another round his eyes , and led him to the river .
Once they had reached the bank he stretched one leg over to the other side , and , catching up Petru in the palm of his hand , set him down on the further shore .
` That is all right , ' said Petru .
Then he played a few notes on his flute , and the giant went to sleep again .
Even the fairies who had been bathing a little lower down heard the music and fell asleep among the flowers on the bank .
Petru saw them as he passed , and thought , ` If they are so beautiful , why should the Fairy of the Dawn be so ugly ? '
But he dared not linger , and pushed on .
And now he was in the wonderful gardens , which seemed more wonderful still than they had done from afar .
But Petru could see no faded flowers , nor any birds , as he hastened through them to the castle .
No one was there to bar his way , for all were asleep .
Even the leaves had ceased to move .
He passed through the courtyard , and entered the castle itself .
What he beheld there need not be told , for all the world knows that the palace of the Fairy of the Dawn is no ordinary place .
Gold and precious stones were as common as wood with us , and the stables where the horses of the sun were kept were more splendid than the palace of the greatest emperor in the world .
Petru went up the stairs and walked quickly through eight-and-forty rooms , hung with silken stuffs , and all empty .
In the forty-ninth he found the Fairy of the Dawn herself .
In the middle of this room , which was as large as a church , Petru saw the celebrated well that he had come so far to seek .
It was a well just like other wells , and it seemed strange that the Fairy of the Dawn should have it in her own chamber ; yet anyone could tell it had been there for hundreds of years .
And by the well slept the Fairy of the Dawn -- the Fairy of the Dawn -- herself !
And as Petru looked at her the magic flute dropped by his side , and he held his breath .
Near the well was a table , on which stood bread made with does ' milk , and a flagon of wine .
It was the bread of strength and the wine of youth , and Petru longed for them .
He looked once at the bread and once at the wine , and then at the Fairy of the Dawn , still sleeping on her silken cushions .
As he looked a mist came over his senses .
The fairy opened her eyes slowly and looked at Petru , who lost his head still further ; but he just managed to remember his flute , and a few notes of it sent the Fairy to sleep again , and he kissed her thrice .
Then he stooped and laid his golden wreath upon her forehead , ate a piece of the bread and drank a cupful of the wine of youth , and this he did three times over .
Then he filled a flask with water from the well , and vanished swiftly .
As he passed through the garden it seemed quite different from what it was before .
The flowers were lovelier , the streams ran quicker , the sunbeams shone brighter , and the fairies seemed gayer .
And all this had been caused by the three kisses Petru had given the Fairy of the Dawn .
He passed everything safely by , and was soon seated in his saddle again .
Faster than the wind , faster than thought , faster than longing , faster than hatred rode Petru .
At length he dismounted , and , leaving his horses at the roadside , went on foot to the house of Venus .
The goddess Venus knew that he was coming , and went to meet him , bearing with her white bread and red wine .
` Welcome back , my prince , ' said she .
` Good day , and many thanks , ' replied the young man , holding out the flask containing the magic water .
She received it with joy , and after a short rest Petru set forth , for he had no time to lose .
He stopped a few minutes , as he had promised , with the Goddess of Thunder , and was taking a hasty farewell of her , when she called him back .
` Stay , I have a warning to give you , ' said she .
` Beware of your life ; make friends with no man ; do not ride fast , or let the water go out of your hand ; believe no one , and flee flattering tongues .
Go , and take care , for the way is long , the world is bad , and you hold something very precious .
But I will give you this cloth to help you .
It is not much to look at , but it is enchanted , and whoever carries it will never be struck by lightning , pierced by a lance , or smitten with a sword , and the arrows will glance off his body . '
Petru thanked her and rode off , and , taking out his treasure box , inquired how matters were going at home .
Not well , it said .
The emperor was blind altogether now , and Florea and Costan had besought him to give the government of the kingdom into their hands ; but he would not , saying that he did not mean to resign the government till he had washed his eyes from the well of the Fairy of the Dawn .
Then the brothers had gone to consult old Birscha , who told them that Petru was already on his way home bearing the water .
They had set out to meet him , and would try to take the magic water from him , and then claim as their reward the government of the emperor .
` You are lying ! '
cried Petru angrily , throwing the box on the ground , where it broke into a thousand pieces .
It was not long before he began to catch glimpses of his native land , and he drew rein near a bridge , the better to look at it .
He was still gazing , when he heard a sound in the distance as if some one was calling hit by his name .
` You , Petru ! '
it said .
` On !
on ! '
cried the horse ; ` it will fare ill with you if you stop . '
` No , let us stop , and see who and what it is ! '
answered Petru , turning his horse round , and coming face to face with his two brothers .
He had forgotten the warning given him by the Goddess of Thunder , and when Costan and Florea drew near with soft and flattering words he jumped straight off his horse , and rushed to embrace them .
He had a thousand questions to ask , and a thousand things to tell .
But his brown horse stood sadly hanging his head .
` Petru , my dear brother , ' at length said Florea , ` would it not be better if we carried the water for you ?
Some one might try to take it from you on the road , while no one would suspect us . '
` So it would , ' added Costan .
` Florea speaks well . '
But Petru shook his head , and told them what the Goddess of Thunder had said , and about the cloth she had given him .
And both brothers understood there was only one way in which they could kill him .
At a stone's throw from where they stood ran a rushing stream , with clear deep pools .
` Don't you feel thirsty , Costan ? '
asked Florea , winking at him .
` Yes , ' replied Costan , understanding directly what was wanted .
` Come , Petru , let us drink now we have the chance , and then we will set out on our way home .
It is a good thing you have us with you , to protect you from harm . '
The horse neighed , and Petru knew what it meant , and did not go with his brothers .
No , he went home to his father , and cured his blindness ; and as for his brothers , they never returned again .
