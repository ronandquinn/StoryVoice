Once upon a time there lived a poor woman who had only one child , and he was a little boy called Hassebu .
When he ceased to be a baby , and his mother thought it was time for him to learn to read , she sent him to school .
And , after he had done with school , he was put into a shop to learn how to make clothes , and did not learn ; and he was put to do silversmith's work , and did not learn ; and whatsoever he was taught , he did not learn it .
His mother never wished him to do anything he did not like , so she said : ` Well , stay at home , my son . '
And he stayed at home , eating and sleeping .
One day the boy said to his mother : ` What was my father's business ? '
` He was a very learned doctor , ' answered she .
` Where , then , are his books ? '
asked Hassebu .
` Many days have passed , and I have thought nothing of them .
But look inside and see if they are there . '
So Hassebu looked , and saw they were eaten by insects , all but one book , which he took away and read .
He was sitting at home one morning poring over the medicine book , when some neighbours came by and said to his mother : ` Give us this boy , that we may go together to cut wood . '
For wood-cutting was their trade , and they loaded several donkeys with the wood , and sold it in the town .
And his mother answered , ` Very well ; to-morrow I will buy him a donkey , and you can all go together . '
So the donkey was bought , and the neighbours came , and they worked hard all day , and in the evening they brought the wood back into the town , and sold it for a good sum of money .
And for six days they went and did the like , but on the seventh it rained , and the wood-cutters ran and hid in the rocks , all but Hassebu , who did not mind wetting , and stayed where he was .
While he was sitting in the place where the wood-cutters had left him , he took up a stone that lay near him , and idly dropped it on the ground .
It rang with a hollow sound , and he called to his companions , and said , ` Come here and listen ; the ground seems hollow ! '
` Knock again ! '
cried they .
And he knocked and listened .
` Let us dig , ' said the boy .
And they dug , and found a large pit like a well , filled with honey up to the brim .
` This is better than firewood , ' said they ; ` it will bring us more money .
And as you have found it , Hassebu , it is you who must go inside and dip out the honey and give to us , and we will take it to the town and sell it , and will divide the money with you . '
The following day each man brought every bowl and vessel he could find at home , and Hassebu filled them all with honey .
And this he did every day for three months .
At the end of that time the honey was very nearly finished , and there was only a little left , quite at the bottom , and that was very deep down , so deep that it seemed as if it must be right in the middle of the earth .
Seeing this , the men said to Hassebu , ` We will put a rope under your arms , and let you down , so that you may scrape up all the honey that is left , and when you have done we will lower the rope again , and you shall make it fast , and we will draw you up . '
` Very well , ' answered the boy , and he went down , and he scraped and scraped till there was not so much honey left as would cover the point of a needle .
` Now I am ready ! '
he cried ; but they consulted together and said , ` Let us leave him there inside the pit , and take his share of the money , and we will tell his mother , `` Your son was caught by a lion and carried off into the forest , and we tried to follow him , but could not . '' '
Then they arose and went into the town and told his mother as they had agreed , and she wept much and made her mourning for many months .
And when the men were dividing the money , one said , ` Let us send a little to our friend's mother , ' and they sent some to her ; and every day one took her rice , and one oil ; one took her meat , and one took her cloth , every day .
It did not take long for Hassebu to find out that his companions had left him to die in the pit , but he had a brave heart , and hoped that he might be able to find a way out for himself .
So he at once began to explore the pit and found it ran back a long way underground .
And by night he slept , and by day he took a little of the honey he had gathered and ate it ; and so many days passed by .
One morning , while he was sitting on a rock having his breakfast , a large scorpion dropped down at his feet , and he took a stone and killed it , fearing it would sting him .
Then suddenly the thought darted into his head , ` This scorpion must have come from somewhere !
Perhaps there is a hole .
I will go and look for it , ' and he felt all round the walls of the pit till he found a very little hole in the roof of the pit , with a tiny glimmer of light at the far end of it .
Then his heart felt glad , and he took out his knife and dug and dug , till the little hole became a big one , and he could wriggle himself through .
And when he had got outside , he saw a large open space in front of him , and a path leading out of it .
He went along the path , on and on , till he reached a large house , with a golden door standing open .
Inside was a great hall , and in the middle of the hall a throne set with precious stones and a sofa spread with the softest cushions .
And he went in and lay down on it , and fell fast asleep , for he had wandered far .
By-and-by there was a sound of people coming through the courtyard , and the measured tramp of soldiers .
This was the King of the Snakes coming in state to his palace .
They entered the hall , but all stopped in surprise at finding a man lying on the king's own bed .
The soldiers wished to kill him at once , but the king said , ` Leave him alone , put me on a chair , ' and the soldiers who were carrying him knelt on the floor , and he slid from their shoulders on to a chair .
When he was comfortably seated , he turned to his soldiers , and bade them wake the stranger gently .
And they woke him , and he sat up and saw many snakes all round him , and one of them very beautiful , decked in royal robes .
` Who are you ? '
asked Hassebu . '
I am the King of the Snakes , ' was the reply , ` and this is my palace .
And will you tell me who you are , and where you come from ? '
` My name is Hassebu , but whence I come I know not , nor whither I go . '
` Then stay for a little with me , ' said the king , and he bade his soldiers bring water from the spring and fruits from the forest , and to set them before the guest .
For some days Hassebu rested and feasted in the palace of the King of the Snakes , and then he began to long for his mother and his own country .
So he said to the King of the Snakes , ` Send me home , I pray . '
But the King of the Snakes answered , ` When you go home , you will do me evil ! ' '
I will do you no evil , ' replied Hassebu ; ` send me home , I pray . '
But the king said , ' I know it .
If I send you home , you will come back , and kill me .
I dare not do it . '
But Hassebu begged so hard that at last the king said , ` Swear that when you get home you will not go to bathe where many people are gathered . '
And Hassebu swore , and the king ordered his soldiers to take Hassebu in sight of his native city .
Then he went straight to his mother's house , and the heart of his mother was glad .
Now the Sultan of the city was very ill , and all the wise men said that the only thing to cure him was the flesh of the King of the Snakes , and that the only man who could get it was a man with a strange mark on his chest .
So the Vizir had set people to watch at the public baths , to see if such a man came there .
For three days Hassebu remembered his promise to the King of the Snakes , and did not go near the baths ; then came a morning so hot he could hardly breathe , and he forgot all about it .
The moment he had slipped off his robe he was taken before the Vizir , who said to him , ` Lead us to the place where the King of the Snakes lives . ' '
I do not know it ! '
answered he , but the Vizir did not believe him , and had him bound and beaten till his back was all torn .
Then Hassebu cried , ` Loose me , that I may take you . '
They went together a long , long way , till they reached the palace of the King of the Snakes .
And Hassebu said to the King : ` It was not I : look at my back and you will see how they drove me to it . '
` Who has beaten you like this ? '
asked the King .
` It was the Vizir , ' replied Hassebu .
` Then I am already dead , ' said the King sadly , ` but you must carry me there yourself . '
So Hassebu carried him .
And on the way the King said , ` When I arrive , I shall be killed , and my flesh will be cooked .
But take some of the water that I am boiled in , and put it in a bottle and lay it on one side .
The Vizir will tell you to drink it , but be careful not to do so .
Then take some more of the water , and drink it , and you will become a great physician , and the third supply you will give to the Sultan .
And when the Vizir comes to you and asks , `` Did you drink what I gave you ? ''
you must answer , `` I did , and this is for you , '' and he will drink it and die !
and your soul will rest . '
And they went their way into the town , and all happened as the King of the Snakes had said .
And the Sultan loved Hassebu , who became a great physician , and cured many sick people .
But he was always sorry for the poor King of the Snakes .
