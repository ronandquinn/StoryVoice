There was once a king who had only one son , and this young man tormented his father from morning till night to allow him to travel in far countries .
For a long time the king refused to give him leave ; but at last , wearied out , he granted permission , and ordered his treasurer to produce a large sum of money for the prince's expenses .
The youth was overjoyed at the thought that he was really going to see the world , and after tenderly embracing his father he set forth .
He rode on for some weeks without meeting with any adventures ; but one night when he was resting at an inn , he came across another traveller , with whom he fell into conversation , in the course of which the stranger inquired if he never played cards .
The young man replied that he was very fond of doing so .
Cards were brought , and in a very short time the prince had lost every penny he possessed to his new acquaintance .
When there was absolutely nothing left at the bottom of the bag , the stranger proposed that they should have just one more game , and that if the prince won he should have the money restored to him , but in case he lost , should remain in the inn for three years , and besides that should be his servant for another three .
The prince agreed to those terms , played , and lost ; so the stranger took rooms for him , and furnished him with bread and water every day for three years .
The prince lamented his lot , but it was no use ; and at the end of three years he was released and had to go to the house of the stranger , who was really the king of a neighbouring country , and be his servant .
Before he had gone very far he met a woman carrying a child , which was crying from hunger .
The prince took it from her , and fed it with his last crust of bread and last drop of water , and then gave it back to its mother .
The woman thanked him gratefully , and said : ` Listen , my lord .
You must walk straight on till you notice a very strong scent , which comes from a garden by the side of the road .
Go in and hide yourself close to a tank , where three doves will come to bathe .
As the last one flies past you , catch hold of its robe of feathers , and refuse to give it back till the dove has promised you three things . '
The young man did as he was told , and everything happened as the woman had said .
He took the robe of feathers from the dove , who gave him in exchange for it a ring , a collar , and one of its own plumes , saying : ` When you are in any trouble , cry `` Come to my aid , O dove ! ''
I am the daughter of the king you are going to serve , who hates your father and made you gamble in order to cause your ruin . '
Thus the prince went on his way , and in course of time he arrived at the king's palace .
As soon as his master knew he was there , the young man was sent for into his presence , and three bags were handed to him with these words : ` Take this wheat , this millet , and this barley , and sow them at once , so that I may have loaves of them all to-morrow . '
The prince stood speechless at this command , but the king did not condescend to give any further explanation , and when he was dismissed the young man flew to the room which had been set aside for him , and pulling out his feather , he cried : ` Dove , dove !
be quick and come . '
` What is it ? '
said the dove , flying in through the open window , and the prince told her of the task before him , and of his despair at being unable to accomplish it .
` Fear nothing ; it will be all right , ' replied the dove , as she flew away again .
The next morning when the prince awoke he saw the three loaves standing beside his bed .
He jumped up and dressed , and he was scarcely ready when a page arrived with the message that he was to go at once into the king's chamber .
Taking the loaves in his arm he followed the boy , and , bowing low , laid them down before the king .
The monarch looked at the loaves for a moment without speaking , then he said : ` Good .
The man who can do this can also find the ring which my eldest daughter dropped into the sea . '
The prince hastened back to his room and summoned the dove , and when she heard this new command she said : ` Now listen .
To-morrow take a knife and a basin and go down to the shore and get into a boat you will find there . '
The young man did not know what he was to do when he was in the boat or where he was to go , but as the dove had come to his rescue before , he was ready to obey her blindly .
When he reached the boat he found the dove perched on one of the masts , and at a signal from her he put to sea ; the wind was behind them and they soon lost sight of land .
The dove then spoke for the first time and said , ` Take that knife and cut off my head , but be careful that not a single drop of blood falls to the ground .
Afterwards you must throw it into the sea . '
Wondering at this strange order , the prince picked up his knife and severed the dove's head from her body at one stroke .
A little while after a dove rose from the water with a ring in its beak , and laying it in the prince's hand , dabbled itself with the blood that was in the basin , when its head became that of a beautiful girl .
Another moment and it had vanished completely , and the prince took the ring and made his way back to the palace .
The king stared with surprise at the sight of the ring , but he thought of another way of getting rid of the young man which was surer even than the other two .
` This evening you will mount my colt and ride him to the field , and break him in properly . '
The prince received this command as silently as he had received the rest , but no sooner was he in his room than he called for the dove , who said : ` Attend to me .
My father longs to see you dead , and thinks he will kill you by this means .
He himself is the colt , my mother is the saddle , my two sisters are the stirrups , and I am the bridle .
Do not forget to take a good club , to help you in dealing with such a crew . '
So the prince mounted the colt , and gave him such a beating that when he came to the palace to announce that the animal was now so meek that it could be ridden by the smallest child , he found the king so bruised that he had to be wrapped in cloths dipped in vinegar , the mother was too stiff to move , and several of the daughters ' ribs were broken .
The youngest , however , was quite unharmed .
That night she came to the prince and whispered to him : ` Now that they are all in too much pain to move , we had better seize our chance and run away .
Go to the stable and saddle the leanest horse you can find there . '
But the prince was foolish enough to choose the fattest : and when they had started and the princess saw what he had done , she was very sorry , for though this horse ran like the wind , the other flashed like thought .
However , it was dangerous to go back , and they rode on as fast as the horse would go .
In the night the king sent for his youngest daughter , and as she did not come he sent again ; but she did not come any the more for that .
The queen , who was a witch , discovered that her daughter had gone off with the prince , and told her husband he must leave his bed and go after them .
The king got slowly up , groaning with pain , and dragged himself to the stables , where he saw the lean horse still in his stall .
Leaping on his back he shook the reins , and his daughter , who knew what to expect and had her eyes open , saw the horse start forward , and in the twinkling of an eye changed her own steed into a cell , the prince into a hermit , and herself into a nun .
When the king reached the chapel , he pulled up his horse and asked if a girl and a young man had passed that way .
The hermit raised his eyes , which were bent on the ground , and said that he had not seen a living creature .
The king , much disgusted at this news , and not knowing what to do , returned home and told his wife that , though he had ridden for miles , he had come across nothing but a hermit and a nun in a cell .
` Why those were the runaways , of course , ' she cried , flying into a passion , ` and if you had only brought a scrap of the nun's dress , or a bit of stone from the wall , I should have had them in my power . '
At these words the king hastened back to the stable , and brought out the lean horse who travelled quicker than thought .
But his daughter saw him coming , and changed her horse into a plot of ground , herself into a rose-tree covered with roses , and the prince into a gardener .
As the king rode up , the gardener looked up from the tree which he was trimming and asked if anything was the matter .
` Have you seen a young man and a girl go by ? '
said the king , and the gardener shook his head and replied that no one had passed that way since he had been working there .
So the king turned his steps homewards and told his wife .
` Idiot ! '
cried she , ` if you had only brought me one of the roses , or a handful of earth , I should have had them in my power .
But there is no time to waste .
I shall have to go with you myself . '
The girl saw them from afar , and a great fear fell on her , for she knew her mother's skill in magic of all kinds .
However , she determined to fight to the end , and changed the horse into a deep pool , herself into an eel , and the prince into a turtle .
But it was no use .
Her mother recognised them all , and , pulling up , asked her daughter if she did not repent and would not like to come home again .
The eel wagged ` No ' with her tail , and the queen told her husband to put a drop of water from the pool into a bottle , because it was only by that means that she could seize hold of her daughter .
The king did as he was bid , and was just in the act of drawing the bottle out of the water after he had filled it , when the turtle knocked against and spilt it all .
The king then filled it a second time , but again the turtle was too quick for him .
The queen saw that she was beaten , and called down a curse on her daughter that the prince should forget all about her .
After having relieved her feelings in this manner , she and the king went back to the palace .
The others resumed their proper shapes and continued their journey , but the princess was so silent that at last the prince asked her what was the matter .
` It is because I know you will soon forget all about me , ' said she , and though he laughed at her and told her it was impossible , she did not cease to believe it .
They rode on and on and on , till they reached the end of the world , where the prince lived , and leaving the girl in an inn he went himself to the palace to ask leave of his father to present her to him as his bride ; but in his joy at seeing his family once more he forgot all about her , and even listened when the king spoke of arranging a marriage for him .
When the poor girl heard this she wept bitterly , and cried out , ` Come to me , my sisters , for I need you badly ! '
In a moment they stood beside her , and the elder one said , ` Do not be sad , all will go well , ' and they told the innkeeper that if any of the king's servants wanted any birds for their master they were to be sent up to them , as they had three doves for sale .
And so it fell out , and as the doves were very beautiful the servant bought them for the king , who admired them so much that he called his son to look at them .
The prince was much pleased with the doves and was coaxing them to come to him , when one fluttered on to the top of the window and said , ` If you could only hear us speak , you would admire us still more . '
And another perched on a table and added , ` Talk away , it might help him to remember ! '
And the third flew on his shoulder and whispered to him , ` Put on this ring , prince , and see if it fits you . '
And it did .
Then they hung a collar round his neck , and held a feather on which was written the name of the dove .
And at last his memory came back to him , and he declared he would marry the princess and nobody else .
So the next day the wedding took place , and they lived happy till they died .
