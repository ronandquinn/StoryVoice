Once upon a time there lived an emperor who was a great conqueror , and reigned over more countries than anyone in the world .
And whenever he subdued a fresh kingdom , he only granted peace on condition that the king should deliver him one of his sons for ten years ' service .
Now on the borders of his kingdom lay a country whose emperor was as brave as his neighbour , and as long as he was young he was the victor in every war .
But as years passed away , his head grew weary of making plans of campaign , and his people wanted to stay at home and till their fields , and at last he too felt that he must do homage to the other emperor .
One thing , however , held him back from this step which day by day he saw more clearly was the only one possible .
His new overlord would demand the service of one of his sons .
And the old emperor had no son ; only three daughters .
Look on which side he would , nothing but ruin seemed to lie before him , and he became so gloomy , that his daughters were frightened , and did everything they could think of to cheer him up , but all to no purpose .
At length one day when they were at dinner , the eldest of the three summoned up all her courage and said to her father : ` What secret grief is troubling you ?
Are your subjects discontented ?
or have we given you cause for displeasure ?
To smooth away your wrinkles , we would gladly shed our blood , for our lives are bound up in yours ; and this you know . '
` My daughter , ' answered the emperor , ` what you say is true .
Never have you given me one moment's pain .
Yet now you can not help me .
Ah !
why is not one of you a boy ! ' '
I don't understand , ' she answered in surprise .
` Tell us what is wrong : and though we are not boys , we are not quite useless ! '
` But what can you do , my dear children ?
Spin , sew , and weave -- that is all your learning .
Only a warrior can deliver me now , a young giant who is strong to wield the battle-axe : whose sword deals deadly blows . '
` But WHY do you need a son so much at present ?
Tell us all about it !
It will not make matters worse if we know ! '
` Listen then , my daughters , and learn the reason of my sorrow .
You have heard that as long as I was young no man ever brought an army against me without it costing him dear .
But the years have chilled my blood and drunk my strength .
And now the deer can roam the forest , my arrows will never pierce his heart ; strange soldiers will set fire to my houses and water their horses at my wells , and my arm can not hinder them .
No , my day is past , and the time has come when I too must bow my head under the yoke of my foe !
But who is to give him the ten years ' service that is part of the price which the vanquished must pay ? ' '
I will , ' cried the eldest girl , springing to her feet .
But her father only shook his head sadly .
` Never will I bring shame upon you , ' urged the girl .
` Let me go .
Am I not a princess , and the daughter of an emperor ? '
` Go then ! '
he said .
The brave girl's heart almost stopped beating from joy , as she set about her preparations .
She was not still for a single moment , but danced about the house , turning chests and wardrobes upside down .
She set aside enough things for a whole year -- dresses embroidered with gold and precious stones , and a great store of provisions .
And she chose the most spirited horse in the stable , with eyes of flame , and a coat of shining silver .
When her father saw her mounted and curvetting about the court , he gave her much wise advice , as to how she was to behave like the young man she appeared to be , and also how to behave as the girl she really was .
Then he gave her his blessing , and she touched her horse with the spur .
The silver armour of herself and her steed dazzled the eyes of the people as she darted past .
She was soon out of sight , and if after a few miles she had not pulled up to allow her escort to join her , the rest of the journey would have been performed alone .
But though none of his daughters were aware of the fact , the old emperor was a magician , and had laid his plans accordingly .
He managed , unseen , to overtake his daughter , and throw a bridge of copper over a stream which she would have to cross .
Then , changing himself into a wolf , he lay down under one of the arches , and waited .
He had chosen his time well , and in about half an hour the sound of a horse's hoofs was heard .
His feet were almost on the bridge , when a big grey wolf with grinning teeth appeared before the princess .
With a deep growl that froze the blood , he drew himself up , and prepared to spring .
The appearance of the wolf was so sudden and so unexpected , that the girl was almost paralysed , and never even dreamt of flight , till the horse leaped violently to one side .
Then she turned him round , and urging him to his fullest speed , never drew rein till she saw the gates of the palace rising before her .
The old emperor , who had got back long since , came to the door to meet her , and touching her shining armour , he said , ` Did I not tell you , my child , that flies do not make honey ? '
The days passed on , and one morning the second princess implored her father to allow her to try the adventure in which her sister had made such a failure .
He listened unwillingly , feeling sure it was no use , but she begged so hard that in the end he consented , and having chosen her arms , she rode away .
But though , unlike her sister , she was quite prepared for the appearance of the wolf when she reached the copper bridge , she showed no greater courage , and galloped home as fast as her horse could carry her .
On the steps of the castle her father was standing , and as still trembling with fright she knelt at his feet , he said gently , ` Did I not tell you , my child , that every bird is not caught in a net ? '
The three girls stayed quietly in the palace for a little while , embroidering , spinning , weaving , and tending their birds and flowers , when early one morning , the youngest princess entered the door of the emperor's private apartments .
` My father , it is my turn now .
Perhaps I shall get the better of that wolf ! '
` What , do you think you are braver than your sisters , vain little one ?
You who have hardly left your long clothes behind you ! '
but she did not mind being laughed at , and answered , ` For your sake , father , I would cut the devil himself into small bits , or even become a devil myself .
I think I shall succeed , but if I fail , I shall come home without more shame than my sisters . '
Still the emperor hesitated , but the girl petted and coaxed him till at last he said , ` Well , well , if you must go , you must .
It remains to be seen what I shall get by it , except perhaps a good laugh when I see you come back with your head bent and your eyes on the ground . '
` He laughs best who laughs last , ' said the princess .
Happy at having got her way , the princess decided that the first thing to be done was to find some old white-haired boyard , whose advice she could trust , and then to be very careful in choosing her horse .
So she went straight to the stables where the most beautiful horses in the empire were feeding in the stalls , but none of them seemed quite what she wanted .
Almost in despair she reached the last box of all , which was occupied by her father's ancient war-horse , old and worn like himself , stretched sadly out on the straw .
The girl's eyes filled with tears , and she stood gazing at him .
The horse lifted his head , gave a little neigh , and said softly , ` You look gentle and pitiful , but I know it is your love for your father which makes you tender to me .
Ah , what a warrior he was , and what good times we shared together !
But now I too have grown old , and my master has forgotten me , and there is no reason to care whether my coat is dull or shining .
Yet , it is not too late , and if I were properly tended , in a week I could vie with any horse in the stables ! '
` And how should you be tended ? '
asked the girl . '
I must be rubbed down morning and evening with rain water , my barley must be boiled in milk , because of my bad teeth , and my feet must be washed in oil . ' '
I should like to try the treatment , as you might help me in carrying out my scheme . '
` Try it then , mistress , and I promise you will never repent . '
So in a week's time the horse woke up one morning with a sudden shiver through all his limbs ; and when it had passed away , he found his skin shining like a mirror , his body as fat as a water melon , his movement light as a chamois .
Then looking at the princess who had come early to the stable , he said joyfully , ` May success await on the steps of my master's daughter , for she has given me back my life .
Tell me what I can do for you , princess , and I will do it . ' '
I want to go to the emperor who is our over-lord , and I have no one to advise me .
Which of all the white-headed boyards shall I choose as counsellor ? '
` If you have me , you need no one else : I will serve you as I served your father , if you will only listen to what I say . ' '
I will listen to everything .
Can you start in three days ? '
` This moment , if you like , ' said the horse .
The preparations of the emperor's youngest daughter were much fewer and simpler than those of her sisters .
They only consisted of some boy's clothes , a small quantity of linen and food , and a little money in case of necessity .
Then she bade farewell to her father , and rode away .
A day's journey from the palace , she reached the copper bridge , but before they came in sight of it , the horse , who was a magician , had warned her of the means her father would take to prove her courage .
Still in spite of his warning she trembled all over when a huge wolf , as thin as if he had fasted for a month , with claws like saws , and mouth as wide as an oven , bounded howling towards her .
For a moment her heart failed her , but the next , touching the horse lightly with her spur , she drew her sword from its sheath , ready to separate the wolf's head from its body at a single blow .
The beast saw the sword , and shrank back , which was the best thing it could do , as now the girl's blood was up , and the light of battle in her eyes .
Then without looking round , she rode across the bridge .
The emperor , proud of this first victory , took a short cut , and waited for her at the end of another day's journey , close to a river , over which he threw a bridge of silver .
And this time he took the shape of a lion .
But the horse guessed this new danger and told the princess how to escape it .
But it is one thing to receive advice when we feel safe and comfortable , and quite another to be able to carry it out when some awful peril is threatening us .
And if the wolf had made the girl quake with terror , it seemed like a lamb beside this dreadful lion .
At the sound of his roar the very trees quivered and his claws were so large that every one of them looked like a cutlass .
The breath of the princess came and went , and her feet rattled in the stirrups .
Suddenly the remembrance flashed across her of the wolf whom she had put to flight , and waving her sword , she rushed so violently on the lion that he had barely time to spring on one side , so as to avoid the blow .
Then , like a flash , she crossed this bridge also .
Now during her whole life , the princess had been so carefully brought up , that she had never left the gardens of the palace , so that the sight of the hills and valleys and tinkling streams , and the song of the larks and blackbirds , made her almost beside herself with wonder and delight .
She longed to get down and bathe her face in the clear pools , and pick the brilliant flowers , but the horse said ` No , ' and quickened his pace , neither turning to the right or the left .
` Warriors , ' he told her , ` only rest when they have won the victory .
You have still another battle to fight , and it is the hardest of all . '
This time it was neither a wolf nor a lion that was waiting for her at the end of the third day's journey , but a dragon with twelve heads , and a golden bridge behind it .
The princess rode up without seeing anything to frighten her , when a sudden puff of smoke and flame from beneath her feet , caused her to look down , and there was the horrible creature twisted and writhing , its twelve heads reared up as if to seize her between them .
The bridle fell from her hand : and the sword which she had just grasped slid back into its sheath , but the horse bade her fear nothing , and with a mighty effort she sat upright and spurred straight on the dragon .
The fight lasted an hour and the dragon pressed her hard .
But in the end , by a well-directed side blow , she cut off one of the heads , and with a roar that seemed to rend the heavens in two , the dragon fell back on the ground , and rose as a man before her .
Although the horse had informed the princess the dragon was really her own father , the girl had hardly believed him , and stared in amazement at the transformation .
But he flung his arms round her and pressed her to his heart saying , ` Now I see that you are as brave as the bravest , and as wise as the wisest .
You have chosen the right horse , for without his help you would have returned with a bent head and downcast eyes .
You have filled me with the hope that you may carry out the task you have undertaken , but be careful to forget none of my counsels , and above all to listen to those of your horse . '
When he had done speaking , the princess knelt down to receive his blessing , and they went their different ways .
The princess rode on and on , till at last she came to the mountains which hold up the roof of the world .
There she met two Genii who had been fighting fiercely for two years , without one having got the least advantage over the other .
Seeing what they took to be a young man seeking adventures , one of the combatants called out , ` Fet-Fruners !
deliver me from my enemy , and I will give you the horn that can be heard the distance of a three days ' journey ; ' while the other cried , ` Fet-Fruners !
help me to conquer this pagan thief , and you shall have my horse , Sunlight . '
Before answering , the princess consulted her own horse as to which offer she should accept , and he advised her to side with the genius who was master of Sunlight , his own younger brother , and still more active than himself .
So the girl at once attacked the other genius , and soon clove his skull ; then the one who was left victor begged her to come back with him to his house and he would hand her over Sunlight , as he had promised .
The mother of the genius was rejoiced to see her son return safe and sound , and prepared her best room for the princess , who , after so much fatigue , needed rest badly .
But the girl declared that she must first make her horse comfortable in his stable ; but this was really only an excuse , as she wanted to ask his advice on several matters .
But the old woman had suspected from the very first that the boy who had come to the rescue of her son was a girl in disguise , and told the genius that she was exactly the wife he needed .
The genius scoffed , and inquired what female hand could ever wield a sabre like that ; but , in spite of his sneers , his mother persisted , and as a proof of what she said , laid at night on each of their pillows a handful of magic flowers , that fade at the touch of man , but remain eternally fresh in the fingers of a woman .
It was very clever of her , but unluckily the horse had warned the princess what to expect , and when the house was silent , she stole very softly to the genius's room , and exchanged his faded flowers for those she held .
Then she crept back to her own bed and fell fast asleep .
At break of day , the old woman ran to see her son , and found , as she knew she would , a bunch of dead flowers in his hand .
She next passed on to the bedside of the princess , who still lay asleep grasping the withered flowers .
But she did not believe any the more that her guest was a man , and so she told her son .
So they put their heads together and laid another trap for her .
After breakfast the genius gave his arm to his guest , and asked her to come with him into the garden .
For some time they walked about looking at the flowers , the genius all the while pressing her to pick any she fancied .
But the princess , suspecting a trap , inquired roughly why they were wasting the precious hours in the garden , when , as men , they should be in the stables looking after their horses .
Then the genius told his mother that she was quite wrong , and his deliverer was certainly a man .
But the old woman was not convinced for all that .
She would try once more she said , and her son must lead his visitor into the armoury , where hung every kind of weapon used all over the world -- some plain and bare , others ornamented with precious stones -- and beg her to make choice of one of them .
The princess looked at them closely , and felt the edges and points of their blades , then she hung at her belt an old sword with a curved blade , that would have done credit to an ancient warrior .
After this she informed the genius that she would start early next day and take Sunlight with her .
And there was nothing for the mother to do but to submit , though she still stuck to her own opinion .
The princess mounted Sunlight , and touched him with her spur , when the old horse , who was galloping at her side , suddenly said : ` Up to this time , mistress , you have obeyed my counsels and all has gone well .
Listen to me once more , and do what I tell you .
I am old , and -- now that there is someone to take my place , I will confess it -- I am afraid that my strength is not equal to the task that lies before me .
Give me leave , therefore , to return home , and do you continue your journey under the care of my brother .
Put your faith in him as you put it in me , and you will never repent .
Wisdom has come early to Sunlight . '
` Yes , my old comrade , you have served me well ; and it is only through your help that up to now I have been victorious .
So grieved though I am to say farewell , I will obey you yet once more , and will listen to your brother as I would to yourself .
Only , I must have a proof that he loves me as well as you do . '
` How should I not love you ? '
answered Sunlight ; ` how should I not be proud to serve a warrior such as you ?
Trust me , mistress , and you shall never regret the absence of my brother .
I know there will be difficulties in our path , but we will face them together . '
Then , with tears in her eyes , the princess took leave of her old horse , who galloped back to her father .
She had ridden only a few miles further , when she saw a golden curl lying on the road before her .
Checking her horse , she asked whether it would be better to take it or let it lie .
` If you take it , ' said Sunlight , ` you will repent , and if you don't , you will repent too : so take it . '
On this the girl dismounted , and picking up the curl , wound it round her neck for safety .
They passed by hills , they passed by mountains , they passed through valleys , leaving behind them thick forests , and fields covered with flowers ; and at length they reached the court of the over-lord .
He was sitting on his throne , surrounded by the sons of the other emperors , who served him as pages .
These youths came forward to greet their new companion , and wondered why they felt so attracted towards him .
However , there was no time for talking and concealing her fright .
The princess was led straight up to the throne , and explained , in a low voice , the reason of her coming .
The emperor received her kindly , and declared himself fortunate at finding a vassal so brave and so charming , and begged the princess to remain in attendance on his person .
She was , however , very careful in her behaviour towards the other pages , whose way of life did not please her .
One day , however , she had been amusing herself by making sweetmeats , when two of the young princes looked in to pay her a visit .
She offered them some of the food which was already on the table , and they thought it so delicious that they even licked their fingers so as not to lose a morsel .
Of course they did not keep the news of their discovery to themselves , but told all their companions that they had just been enjoying the best supper they had had since they were born .
And from that moment the princess was left no peace , till she had promised to cook them all a dinner .
Now it happened that , on the very day fixed , all the cooks in the palace became intoxicated , and there was no one to make up the fire .
When the pages heard of this shocking state of things , they went to their companion and implored her to come to the rescue .
The princess was fond of cooking , and was , besides , very good-natured ; so she put on an apron and went down to the kitchen without delay .
When the dinner was placed before the emperor he found it so nice that he ate much more than was good for him .
The next morning , as soon as he woke , he sent for his head cook , and told him to send up the same dishes as before .
The cook , seized with fright at this command , which he knew he could not fulfil , fell on his knees , and confessed the truth .
The emperor was so astonished that he forgot to scold , and while he was thinking over the matter , some of his pages came in and said that their new companion had been heard to boast that he knew where Iliane was to be found -- the celebrated Iliane of the song which begins : ` Golden Hair The fields are green , ' and that to their certain knowledge he had a curl of her hair in his possession .
When he heard that , the emperor desired the page to be brought before him , and , as soon as the princess obeyed his summons , he said to her abruptly : ` Fet-Fruners , you have hidden from me the fact that you knew the golden-haired Iliane !
Why did you do this ?
for I have treated you more kindly than all my other pages . '
Then , after making the princess show him the golden curl which she wore round her neck , he added : ` Listen to me ; unless by some means or other you bring me the owner of this lock , I will have your head cut off in the place where you stand .
Now go ! '
In vain the poor girl tried to explain how the lock of hair came into her possession ; the emperor would listen to nothing , and , bowing low , she left his presence and went to consult Sunlight what she was to do .
At his first words she brightened up .
` Do not be afraid , mistress ; only last night my brother appeared to me in a dream and told me that a genius had carried off Iliane , whose hair you picked up on the road .
But Iliane declares that , before she marries her captor , he must bring her , as a present , the whole stud of mares which belong to her .
The genius , half crazy with love , thinks of nothing night and day but how this can be done , and meanwhile she is quite safe in the island swamps of the sea .
Go back to the emperor and ask him for twenty ships filled with precious merchandise .
The rest you shall know by-and-by . '
On hearing this advice , the princess went at once into the emperor's presence .
` May a long life be yours , O Sovereign all mighty ! '
said she . '
I have come to tell you that I can do as you command if you will give me twenty ships , and load them with the most precious wares in your kingdom . '
` You shall have all that I possess if you will bring me the golden-haired Iliane , ' said the emperor .
The ships were soon ready , and the princess entered the largest and finest , with Sunlight at her side .
Then the sails were spread and the voyage began .
For seven weeks the wind blew them straight towards the west , and early one morning they caught sight of the island swamps of the sea .
They cast anchor in a little bay , and the princess made haste to disembark with Sunlight , but , before leaving the ship , she tied to her belt a pair of tiny gold slippers , adorned with precious stones .
Then mounting Sunlight , she rode about till she came to several palaces , built on hinges , so that they could always turn towards the sun .
The most splendid of these was guarded by three slaves , whose greedy eyes were caught by the glistening gold of the slippers .
They hastened up to the owner of these treasures , and inquired who he was . '
A merchant , ' replied the princess , ` who had somehow missed his road , and lost himself among the island swamps of the sea . '
Not knowing if it was proper to receive him or not , the slaves returned to their mistress and told her all they had seen , but not before she had caught sight of the merchant from the roof of her palace .
Luckily her gaoler was away , always trying to catch the stud of mares , so for the moment she was free and alone .
The slaves told their tale so well that their mistress insisted on going down to the shore and seeing the beautiful slippers for herself .
They were even lovelier than she expected , and when the merchant besought her to come on board , and inspect some that he thought were finer still , her curiosity was too great to refuse , and she went .
Once on board ship , she was so busy turning over all the precious things stored there , that she never knew that the sails were spread , and that they were flying along with the wind behind them ; and when she did know , she rejoiced in her heart , though she pretended to weep and lament at being carried captive a second time .
Thus they arrived at the court of the emperor .
They were just about to land , when the mother of the genius stood before them .
She had learnt that Iliane had fled from her prison in company with a merchant , and , as her son was absent , had come herself in pursuit .
Striding over the blue waters , hopping from wave to wave , one foot reaching to heaven , and the other planted in the foam , she was close at their heels , breathing fire and flame , when they stepped on shore from the ship .
One glance told Iliane who the horrible old woman was , and she whispered hastily to her companion .
Without saying a word , the princess swung her into Sunlight's saddle , and leaping up behind her , they were off like a flash .
It was not till they drew near the town that the princess stooped and asked Sunlight what they should do .
` Put your hand into my left ear , ' said he , ` and take out a sharp stone , which you must throw behind you . '
The princess did as she was told , and a huge mountain sprang up behind them .
The mother of the genius began to climb up it , and though they galloped quickly , she was quicker still .
They heard her coming , faster , faster ; and again the princess stooped to ask what was to be done now .
` Put your hand into my right ear , ' said the horse , ` and throw the brush you will find there behind you . '
The princess did so , and a great forest sprang up behind them , and , so thick were its leaves , that even a wren could not get through .
But the old woman seized hold of the branches and flung herself like a monkey from one to the others , and always she drew nearer -- always , always -- till their hair was singed by the flames of her mouth .
Then , in despair , the princess again bent down and asked if there was nothing more to be done , and Sunlight replied ` Quick , quick , take off the betrothal ring on the finger of Iliane and throw it behind you . '
This time there sprang up a great tower of stone , smooth as ivory , hard as steel , which reached up to heaven itself .
And the mother of the genius gave a howl of rage , knowing that she could neither climb it nor get through it .
But she was not beaten yet , and gathering herself together , she made a prodigious leap , which landed her on the top of the tower , right in the middle of Iliane's ring which lay there , and held her tight .
Only her claws could be seen grasping the battlements .
All that could be done the old witch did ; but the fire that poured from her mouth never reached the fugitives , though it laid waste the country a hundred miles round the tower , like the flames of a volcano .
Then , with one last effort to free herself , her hands gave way , and , falling down to the bottom of the tower , she was broken in pieces .
When the flying princess saw what had happened she rode back to the spot , as Sunlight counselled her , and placed her finger on the top of the tower , which was gradually shrinking into the earth .
In an instant the tower had vanished as if it had never been , and in its place was the finger of the princess with a ring round it .
The emperor received Iliane with all the respect that was due to her , and fell in love at first sight besides .
But this did not seem to please Iliane , whose face was sad as she walked about the palace or gardens , wondering how it was that , while other girls did as they liked , she was always in the power of someone whom she hated .
So when the emperor asked her to share his throne Iliane answered : ` Noble Sovereign , I may not think of marriage till my stud of horses has been brought me , with their trappings all complete . '
When he heard this , the emperor once more sent for Fet-Fruners , and said : ` Fet-Fruners , fetch me instantly the stud of mares , with their trappings all complete .
If not , your head shall pay the forfeit . '
` Mighty Emperor , I kiss your hands !
I have but just returned from doing your bidding , and , behold , you send me on another mission , and stake my head on its fulfilment , when your court is full of valiant young men , pining to win their spurs .
They say you are a just man ; then why not entrust this quest to one of them ?
Where am I to seek these mares that I am to bring you ? '
` How do I know ?
They may be anywhere in heaven or earth ; but , wherever they are , you will have to find them . '
The princess bowed and went to consult Sunlight .
He listened while she told her tale , and then said : ` Fetch quickly nine buffalo skins ; smear them well with tar , and lay them on my back .
Do not fear ; you will succeed in this also ; but , in the end , the emperor's desires will be his undoing . '
The buffalo skins were soon got , and the princess started off with Sunlight .
The way was long and difficult , but at length they reached the place where the mares were grazing .
Here the genius who had carried off Iliane was wandering about , trying to discover how to capture them , all the while believing that Iliane was safe in the palace where he had left her .
As soon as she caught sight of him , the princess went up and told him that Iliane had escaped , and that his mother , in her efforts to recapture her , had died of rage .
At this news a blind fury took possession of the genius , and he rushed madly upon the princess , who awaited his onslaught with perfect calmness .
As he came on , with his sabre lifted high in the air , Sunlight bounded right over his head , so that the sword fell harmless .
And when in her turn the princess prepared to strike , the horse sank upon his knees , so that the blade pierced the genius's thigh .
The fight was so fierce that it seemed as if the earth would give way under them , and for twenty miles round the beasts in the forests fled to their caves for shelter .
At last , when her strength was almost gone , the genius lowered his sword for an instant .
The princess saw her chance , and , with one swoop of her arm , severed her enemy's head from his body .
Still trembling from the long struggle , she turned away , and went to the meadow where the stud were feeding .
By the advice of Sunlight , she took care not to let them see her , and climbed a thick tree , where she could see and hear without being seen herself .
Then he neighed , and the mares came galloping up , eager to see the new comer -- all but one horse , who did not like strangers , and thought they were very well as they were .
As Sunlight stood his ground , well pleased with the attention paid him , this sulky creature suddenly advanced to the charge , and bit so violently that had it not been for the nine buffalo skins Sunlight's last moment would have come .
When the fight was ended , the buffalo skins were in ribbons , and the beaten animal writhing with pain on the grass .
Nothing now remained to be done but to drive the whole stud to the emperor's court .
So the princess came down from the tree and mounted Sunlight , while the stud followed meekly after , the wounded horse bringing up the rear .
On reaching the palace , she drove them into a yard , and went to inform the emperor of her arrival .
The news was told at once to Iliane , who ran down directly and called them to her one by one , each mare by its name .
And at the first sight of her the wounded animal shook itself quickly , and in a moment its wounds were healed , and there was not even a mark on its glossy skin .
By this time the emperor , on hearing where she was , joined her in the yard , and at her request ordered the mares to be milked , so that both he and she might bathe in the milk and keep young for ever .
But they would suffer no one to come near them , and the princess was commanded to perform this service also .
At this , the heart of the girl swelled within her .
The hardest tasks were always given to her , and long before the two years were up , she would be worn out and useless .
But while these thoughts passed through her mind , a fearful rain fell , such as no man remembered before , and rose till the mares were standing up to their knees in water .
Then as suddenly it stopped , and , behold !
the water was ice , which held the animals firmly in its grasp .
And the princess's heart grew light again , and she sat down gaily to milk them , as if she had done it every morning of her life .
The love of the emperor for Iliane waxed greater day by day , but she paid no heed to him , and always had an excuse ready to put off their marriage .
At length , when she had come to the end of everything she could think of , she said to him one day : ` Grant me , Sire , just one request more , and then I will really marry you ; for you have waited patiently this long time . '
` My beautiful dove , ' replied the emperor , ` both I and all I possess are yours , so ask your will , and you shall have it . '
` Get me , then , ' she said , ' a flask of the holy water that is kept in a little church beyond the river Jordan , and I will be your wife . '
Then the emperor ordered Fet-Fruners to ride without delay to the river Jordan , and to bring back , at whatever cost , the holy water for Iliane .
` This , my mistress , ' said Sunlight , when she was saddling him , ` is the last and most difficult of your tasks .
But fear nothing , for the hour of the emperor has struck . '
So they started ; and the horse , who was not a wizard for nothing , told the princess exactly where she was to look for the holy water .
` It stands , ' he said , ` on the altar of a little church , and is guarded by a troop of nuns .
They never sleep , night or day , but every now and then a hermit comes to visit them , and from him they learn certain things it is needful for them to know .
When this happens , only one of the nuns remains on guard at a time , and if we are lucky enough to hit upon this moment , we may get hold of the vase at once ; if not , we shall have to wait the arrival of the hermit , however long it may be ; for there is no other means of obtaining the holy water . '
They came in sight of the church beyond the Jordan , and , to their great joy , beheld the hermit just arriving at the door .
They could hear him calling the nuns around him , and saw them settle themselves under a tree , with the hermit in their midst -- all but one , who remained on guard , as was the custom .
The hermit had a great deal to say , and the day was very hot , so the nun , tired of sitting by herself , lay down right across the threshold , and fell sound asleep .
Then Sunlight told the princess what she was to do , and the girl stepped softly over the sleeping nun , and crept like a cat along the dark aisle , feeling the wall with her fingers , lest she should fall over something and ruin it all by a noise .
But she reached the altar in safety , and found the vase of holy water standing on it .
This she thrust into her dress , and went back with the same care as she came .
With a bound she was in the saddle , and seizing the reins bade Sunlight take her home as fast as his legs could carry him .
The sound of the flying hoofs aroused the nun , who understood instantly that the precious treasure was stolen , and her shrieks were so loud and piercing that all the rest came flying to see what was the matter .
The hermit followed at their heels , but seeing it was impossible to overtake the thief , he fell on his knees and called his most deadly curse down on her head , praying that if the thief was a man , he might become a woman ; and if she was a woman , that she might become a man .
In either case he thought that the punishment would be severe .
But punishments are things about which people do not always agree , and when the princess suddenly felt she was really the man she had pretended to be , she was delighted , and if the hermit had only been within reach she would have thanked him from her heart .
By the time she reached the emperor's court , Fet-Fruners looked a young man all over in the eyes of everyone ; and even the mother of the genius would now have had her doubts set at rest .
He drew forth the vase from his tunic and held it up to the emperor , saying : ` Mighty Sovereign , all hail !
I have fulfilled this task also , and I hope it is the last you have for me ; let another now take his turn . ' '
I am content , Fet-Fruners , ' replied the emperor , ` and when I am dead it is you who will sit upon my throne ; for I have yet no son to come after me .
But if one is given me , and my dearest wish is accomplished , then you shall be his right hand , and guide him with your counsels . '
But though the emperor was satisfied , Iliane was not , and she determined to revenge herself on the emperor for the dangers which he had caused Fet-Fruners to run .
And as for the vase of holy water , she thought that , in common politeness , her suitor ought to have fetched it himself , which he could have done without any risk at all .
So she ordered the great bath to be filled with the milk of her mares , and begged the emperor to clothe himself in white robes , and enter the bath with her , an invitation he accepted with joy .
Then , when both were standing with the milk reaching to their necks , she sent for the horse which had fought Sunlight , and made a secret sign to him .
The horse understood what he was to do , and from one nostril he breathed fresh air over Iliane , and from the other , he snorted a burning wind which shrivelled up the emperor where he stood , leaving only a little heap of ashes .
His strange death , which no one could explain , made a great sensation throughout the country , and the funeral his people gave him was the most splendid ever known .
When it was over , Iliane summoned Fet-Fruners before her , and addressed him thus : ` Fet-Fruners !
it is you who brought me and have saved my life , and obeyed my wishes .
It is you who gave me back my stud ; you who killed the genius , and the old witch his mother ; you who brought me the holy water .
And you , and none other , shall be my husband . '
` Yes , I will marry you , ' said the young man , with a voice almost as soft as when he was a princess .
` But know that in OUR house , it will be the cock who sings and not the hen ! '
