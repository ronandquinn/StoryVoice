Once upon a time there was a king who determined to take a long voyage .
He assembled his fleet and all the seamen , and set out .
They went straight on night and day , until they came to an island which was covered with large trees , and under every tree lay a lion .
As soon as the King had landed his men , the lions all rose up together and tried to devour them .
After a long battle they managed to overcome the wild beasts , but the greater number of the men were killed .
Those who remained alive now went on through the forest and found on the other side of it a beautiful garden , in which all the plants of the world flourished together .
There were also in the garden three springs : the first flowed with silver , the second with gold , and the third with pearls .
The men unbuckled their knapsacks and filled them with those precious things .
In the middle of the garden they found a large lake , and when they reached the edge of it the Lake began to speak , and said to them , ` What men are you , and what brings you here ?
Are you come to visit our king ? '
But they were too much frightened to answer .
Then the Lake said , ` You do well to be afraid , for it is at your peril that you are come hither .
Our king , who has seven heads , is now asleep , but in a few minutes he will wake up and come to me to take his bath !
Woe to anyone who meets him in the garden , for it is impossible to escape from him .
This is what you must do if you wish to save your lives .
Take off your clothes and spread them on the path which leads from here to the castle .
The King will then glide over something soft , which he likes very much , and he will be so pleased with that that he will not devour you .
He will give you some punishment , but then he will let you go . '
The men did as the Lake advised them , and waited for a time .
At noon the earth began to quake , and opened in many places , and out of the openings appeared lions , tigers , and other wild beasts , which surrounded the castle , and thousands and thousands of beasts came out of the castle following their king , the Seven-headed Serpent .
The Serpent glided over the clothes which were spread for him , came to the Lake , and asked it who had strewed those soft things on the path ?
The Lake answered that it had been done by people who had come to do him homage .
The King commanded that the men should be brought before him .
They came humbly on their knees , and in a few words told him their story .
Then he spoke to them with a mighty and terrible voice , and said , ` Because you have dared to come here , I lay upon you the punishment .
Every year you must bring me from among your people twelve youths and twelve maidens , that I may devour them .
If you do not do this , I will destroy your whole nation . '
Then he desired one of his beasts to show the men the way out of the garden , and dismissed them .
They then left the island and went back to their own country , where they related what had happened to them .
Soon the time came round when the king of the beasts would expect the youths and maidens to be brought to him .
The King therefore issued a proclamation inviting twelve youths and twelve maidens to offer themselves up to save their country ; and immediately many young people , far more than enough , hastened to do so .
A new ship was built , and set with black sails , and in it the youths and maidens who were appointed for the king of the beasts embarked and set out for his country .
When they arrived there they went at once to the Lake , and this time the lions did not stir , nor did the springs flow , and neither did the Lake speak .
So they waited then , and it was not long before the earth quaked even more terribly than the first time .
The Seven-headed Serpent came without his train of beasts , saw his prey waiting for him , and devoured it at one mouthful .
Then the ship 's crew returned home , and the same thing happened yearly until many years had passed .
Now the King of this unhappy country was growing old , and so was the Queen , and they had no children .
One day the Queen was sitting at the window weeping bitterly because she was childless , and knew that the crown would therefore pass to strangers after the King 's death .
Suddenly a little old woman appeared before her , holding an apple in her hand , and said , ` Why do you weep , my Queen , and what makes you so unhappy ? '
` Alas , good mother , ' answered the Queen , ' I am unhappy because I have no children . '
` Is that what vexes you ? '
said the old woman .
` Listen to me .
I am a nun from the Spinning Convent ,and my mother when she died left me this apple .
Whoever eats this apple shall have a child . '
The Queen gave money to the old woman , and bought the apple from her .
Then she peeled it , ate it , and threw the rind out of the window , and it so happened that a mare that was running loose in the court below ate up the rind .
After a time the Queen had a little boy , and the mare also had a male foal .
The boy and the foal grew up together and loved each other like brothers .
In course of time the King died , and so did the Queen , and their son , who was now nineteen years old , was left alone .
One day , when he and his horse were talking together , the Horse said to him , ` Listen to me , for I love you and wish for your good and that of the country .
If you go on every year sending twelve youths and twelve maidens to the King of the Beasts , your country will very soon be ruined .
Mount upon my back : I will take you to a woman who can direct you how to kill the Seven-headed Serpent . '
Then the youth mounted his horse , who carried him far away to a mountain which was hollow , for in its side was a great underground cavern .
In the cavern sat an old woman spinning .
This was the cloister of the nuns , and the old woman was the Abbess .
They all spent their time in spinning , and that is why the convent has this name .
All round the walls of the cavern there were beds cut out of the solid rock , upon which the nuns slept , and in the middle a light was burning .
It was the duty of the nuns to watch the light in turns , that it might never go out , and if anyone of them let it go out the others put her to death .
As soon as the King 's son saw the old Abbess spinning he threw himself at her feet and entreated her to tell him how he could kill the Seven-headed Serpent .
She made the youth rise , embraced him , and said , ` Know , my son , that it is I who sent the nun to your mother and caused you to be born , and with you the horse , with whose help you will be able to free the world from the monster .
I will tell you what you have to do .
Load your horse with cotton , and go by a secret passage which I will show you , which is hidden from the wild beasts , to the Serpent 's palace .
You will find the King asleep upon his bed , which is all hung round with bells , and over his bed you will see a sword hanging .
With this sword only it is possible to kill the Serpent , because even if its blade breaks a new one will grow again for every head the monster has .
Thus you will be able to cut off all his seven heads .
And this you must also do in order to deceive the King : you must slip into his bed-chamber very softly , and stop up all the bells which are round his bed with cotton .
Then take down the sword gently , and quickly give the monster a blow on his tail with it .
This will make him waken up , and if he catches sight of you he will seize you .
But you must quickly cut off his first head , and then wait till the next one comes up .
Then strike it off also , and so go on till you have cut off all his seven heads . '
The old Abbess then gave the Prince her blessing , and he set out upon his enterprise , arrived at the Serpent 's castle by following the secret passage which she had shown him , and by carefully attending to all her directions he happily succeeded in killing the monster .
As soon as the wild beasts heard of their king 's death , they all hastened to the castle , but the youth had long since mounted his horse and was already far out of their reach .
They pursued him as fast as they could , but they found it impossible to overtake him , and he reached home in safety .
Thus he freed his country from this terrible oppression .
