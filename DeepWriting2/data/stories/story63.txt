Once upon a time , far away in the east country , there lived a king who loved hunting so much that , when once there was a deer in sight , he was careless of his own safety .
Indeed , he often became quite separated from his nobles and attendants , and in fact was particularly fond of lonely adventures .
Another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well , and could not be seen ; and then , with the knowledge only of his faithful Grand Wazeer , to disguise himself as a pedlar , load a donkey with cheap wares , and travel about .
In this way he found out what the common people said about him , and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties .
One day his queen presented him with a baby daughter as beautiful as the dawn , and the king himself was so happy and delighted that , for a whole week , he forgot to hunt , and spent the time in public and private rejoicing .
Not long afterwards , however , he went out after some deer which were to be found in a far corner of his forests .
In the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snow-white stag , and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost .
So he put the spurs to his horse , and followed it as hard as he could gallop .
Of course all his attendants followed at the best speed that they could manage ; but the king was so splendidly mounted , and the stag was so swift , that , at the end of an hour , the king found that only his favourite hound and himself were in the chase ; all the rest were far , far behind and out of sight .
Nothing daunted , however , he went on and on , till he perceived that he was entering a valley with great rocky mountains on all sides , and that his horse was getting very tired and trembled at every stride .
Worse than all evening was already drawing on , and the sun would soon set .
In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag .
Every shot fell short , or went wide of the mark ; and at last , just as darkness was setting in , he lost sight altogether of the beast .
By this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue , his hound staggered panting along beside him , he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before , and had quite missed his way , and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight .
All this was very discouraging , but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful stag .
That troubled him a good deal , but he never worried over what he could not help , so he got down from his horse , slipped his arm through the bridle , and led the animal along the rough path in hopes of discovering some shepherd's hut , or , at least , a cave or shelter under some rock , where he might pass the night .
Presently he heard the sound of rushing water , and made towards it .
He toiled over a steep rocky shoulder of a hill , and there , just below him , was a stream dashing down a precipitous glen , and , almost beneath his feet , twinkling and flickering from the level of the torrent , was a dim light as of a lamp .
Towards this light the king with his horse and hound made his way , sliding and stumbling down a steep , stony path .
At the bottom the king found a narrow grassy ledge by the brink of the stream , across which the light from a rude lantern in the mount of a cave shed a broad beam of uncertain light .
At the edge of the stream sat an old hermit with a long white beard , who neither spoke nor moved as the king approached , but sat throwing into the stream dry leaves which lay scattered about the ground near him .
` Peace be upon you , ' said the king , giving the usual country salutation .
` And upon you peace , ' answered the hermit ; but still he never looked up , nor stopped what he was doing .
For a minute or two the king stood watching him .
He noticed that the hermit threw two leaves in at a time , and watched them attentively .
Sometimes both were carried rapidly down by the stream ; sometimes only one leaf was carried off , and the other , after whirling slowly round and round on the edge of the current , would come circling back on an eddy to the hermit's feet .
At other times both leaves were held in the backward eddy , and failed to reach the main current of the noisy stream .
` What are you doing ? '
asked the king at last , and the hermit replied that he was reading the fates of men ; every one's fate , he said , was settled from the beginning , and , whatever it were , there was no escape from it .
The king laughed . '
I care little , ' he said , ` what my fate may be ; but I should be curious to know the fate of my little daughter . ' '
I can not say , ' answered the hermit .
` Do you not know , then ? '
demanded the king . '
I might know , ' returned the hermit , ` but it is not always wisdom to know much . '
But the king was not content with this reply , and began to press the old man to say what he knew , which for a long time he would not do .
At last , however , the king urged him so greatly that he said : ` The king's daughter will marry the son of a poor slave-girl called Puruna , who belongs to the king of the land of the north .
There is no escaping from Fate . '
The king was wild with anger at hearing these words , but he was also very tired ; so he only laughed , and answered that he hoped there would be a way out of THAT fate anyhow .
Then he asked if the hermit could shelter him and his beasts for the night , and the hermit said ` Yes ' ; so , very soon the king had watered and tethered his horse , and , after a supper of bread and parched peas , lay down in the cave , with the hound at his feet , and tried to go to sleep .
But instead of sleeping he only lay awake and thought of the hermit's prophecy ; and the more he thought of it the angrier he felt , until he gnashed his teeth and declared that it should never , never come true .
Morning came , and the king got up , pale and sulky , and , after learning from the hermit which path to take , was soon mounted and found his way home without much difficulty .
Directly he reached his palace he wrote a letter to the king of the land of the north , begging him , as a favour , to sell him his slave girl Puruna and her son , and saying that , if he consented , he would send a messenger to receive them at the river which divided the kingdoms .
For five days he awaited the reply , and hardly slept or ate , but was as cross as could be all the time .
On the fifth day his messenger returned with a letter to say that the king of the land of the north would not sell , but he would give , the king the slave girl and her son .
The king was overjoyed .
He sent for his Grand Wazeer and told him that he was going on one of his lonely expeditions , and that the Wazeer must invent some excuse to account for his absence .
Next he disguised himself as an ordinary messenger , mounted a swift camel , and sped away to the place where the slave girl was to be handed over to him .
When he got there he gave the messengers who brought her a letter of thanks and a handsome present for their master and rewards for themselves ; and then without delay he took the poor woman and her tiny baby-boy up on to his camel and rode off to a wild desert .
After riding for a day and a night , almost without stopping , he came to a great cave where he made the woman dismount , and , taking her and the baby into the cave , he drew his sword and with one blow chopped her head off .
But although his anger made him cruel enough for anything so dreadful , the king felt that he could not turn his great sword on the helpless baby , who he was sure must soon die in this solitary place without its mother ; so he left it in the cave where it was , and , mounting his camel , rode home as fast as he could .
Now , in a small village in his kingdom there lived an old widow who had no children or relations of any kind .
She made her living mostly by selling the milk of a flock of goats ; but she was very , very poor , and not very strong , and often used to wonder how she would live if she got too weak or ill to attend to her goats .
Every morning she drove the goats out into the desert to graze on the shrubs and bushes which grew there , and every evening they came home of themselves to be milked and to be shut up safely for the night .
One evening the old woman was astonished to find that her very best nanny-goat returned without a drop of milk .
She thought that some naughty boy or girl was playing a trick upon her and had caught the goat on its way home and stolen all the milk .
But when evening after evening the goat remained almost dry she determined to find out who the thief was .
So the next day she followed the goats at a distance and watched them while they grazed .
At length , in the afternoon , the old woman noticed this particular nanny-goat stealing off by herself away from the herd and she at once went after her .
On and on the goat walked for some way , and then disappeared into a cave in the rocks .
The old woman followed the goat into the cave and then , what should she see but the animal giving her milk to a little boy-baby , whilst on the ground near by lay the sad remains of the baby's dead mother !
Wondering and frightened , the old woman thought at last that this little baby might be a son to her in her old age , and that he would grow up and in time to come be her comfort and support .
So she carried home the baby to her hut , and next day she took a spade to the cave and dug a grave where she buried the poor mother .
Years passed by , and the baby grew up into a find handsome lad , as daring as he was beautiful , and as industrious as he was brave .
One day , when the boy , whom the old woman had named Nur Mahomed , was about seventeen years old , he was coming from his day's work in the fields , when he saw a strange donkey eating the cabbages in the garden which surround their little cottage .
Seizing a big stick , he began to beat the intruder and to drive him out of his garden .
A neighbour passing by called out to him -- ` Hi !
I say !
why are you beating the pedlar's donkey like that ? '
` The pedlar should keep him from eating my cabbages , ' said Nur Mahomed ; ` if he comes this evening here again I'll cut off his tail for him ! '
Whereupon he went off indoors , whistling cheerfully .
It happened that this neighbour was one of those people who make mischief by talking too much ; so , meeting the pedlar in the ` serai , ' or inn , that evening , he told him what had occurred , and added : ` Yes ; and the young spitfire said that if beating the donkey would not do , he would beat you also , and cut your nose off for a thief ! '
A few days later , the pedlar having moved on , two men appeared in the village inquiring who it was who had threatened to ill-treat and to murder an innocent pedlar .
They declared that the pedlar , in fear of his life , had complained to the king ; and that they had been sent to bring the lawless person who had said these things before the king himself .
Of course they soon found out about the donkey eating Nur Mahomed's cabbages , and about the young man's hot words ; but although the lad assured them that he had never said anything about murdering anyone , they replied they were ordered to arrest him , and bring him to take his trial before the king .
So , in spite of his protests , and the wails of his mother , he was carried off , and in due time brought before the king .
Of course Nur Mahomed never guessed that the supposed pedlar happened to have been the king himself , although nobody knew it .
But as he was very angry at what he had been told , he declared that he was going to make an example of this young man , and intended to teach him that even poor travelling pedlars could get justice in HIS country , and be protected from such lawlessness .
However , just as he was going to pronounce some very heavy sentence , there was a stir in the court , and up came Nur Mahomed's old mother , weeping and lamenting , and begging to be heard .
The king ordered her to speak , and she began to plead for the boy , declaring how good he was , and how he was the support of her old age , and if he were put in prison she would die .
The king asked her who she was .
She replied that she was his mother .
` His mother ? '
said the king ; ` you are too old , surely , to have so young a son ! '
Then the old woman , in her fright and distress , confessed the whole story of how she found the baby , and how she rescued and brought him up , and ended by beseeching the king for mercy .
It is easy to guess how , as the story came out , the king looked blacker and blacker , and more and more grim , until at last he was half fainting with rage and astonishment .
This , then , was the baby he had left to die , after cruelly murdering his mother !
Surely fate might have spared him this !
He wished he had sufficient excuse to put the boy to death , for the old hermit's prophecy came back to him as strongly as ever ; and yet the young man had done nothing bad enough to deserve such a punishment .
Everyone would call him a tyrant if he were to give such an order -- in fact , he dared not try it !
At length he collected himself enough to say : -- ` If this young man will enlist in my army I will let him off .
We have need of such as him , and a little discipline will do him good . '
Still the old woman pleaded that she could not live without her son , and was nearly as terrified at the idea of his becoming a soldier as she was at the thought of his being put in prison .
But at length the king -- determined to get the youth into his clutches -- pacified her by promising her a pension large enough to keep her in comfort ; and Nur Mahomed , to his own great delight , was duly enrolled in the king's army .
As a soldier Nur Mahomed seemed to be in luck .
He was rather surprised , but much pleased , to find that he was always one of those chosen when any difficult or dangerous enterprise was afoot ; and , although he had the narrowest escapes on some occasions , still , the very desperateness of the situations in which he found himself gave him special chances of displaying his courage .
And as he was also modest and generous , he became a favourite with his officers and his comrades .
Thus it was not very surprising that , before very long , he became enrolled amongst the picked men of the king's bodyguard .
The fact is , that the king had hoped to have got him killed in some fight or another ; but , seeing that , on the contrary , he throve on hard knocks , he was now determined to try more direct and desperate methods .
One day , soon after Nur Mahomed had entered the bodyguard , he was selected to be one of the soldiers told off to escort the king through the city .
The procession was marching on quite smoothly , when a man , armed with a dagger , rushed out of an alley straight towards the king .
Nur Mahomed , who was the nearest of the guards , threw himself in the way , and received the stab that had been apparently intended for the king .
Luckily the blow was a hurried one , and the dagger glanced on is breastbone , so that , although he received a severe wound , his youth and strength quickly got the better of it .
The king was , of course , obliged to take some notice of this brave deed , and as a reward made him one of his own attendants .
After this the strange adventures the young man passed through were endless .
Officers of the bodyguard were often sent on all sorts of secret and difficult errands , and such errands had a curious way of becoming necessary when Nur Mahomed was on duty .
Once , while he was taking a journey , a foot-bridge gave way under him ; once he was attacked by armed robbers ; a rock rolled down upon him in a mountain pass ; a heavy stone coping fell from a roof at his feet in a narrow city alley .
Altogether , Nur Mahomed began to think that , somewhere or other , he had made an enemy ; but he was light-hearted , and the thought did not much trouble him .
He escaped somehow every time , and felt amused rather than anxious about the next adventure .
It was the custom of that city that the officer for the day of the palace guards should receive all his food direct from the king's kitchen .
One day , when Nur Mahomed's turn came to be on duty , he was just sitting down to a delicious stew that had been sent in from the palace , when one of those gaunt , hungry dogs , which , in eastern countries , run about the streets , poked his nose in at the open guard-room door , and looked at Nur Mahomed with mouth watering and nostrils working .
The kind-hearted young man picked out a lump of meat , went to the door , and threw it outside to him .
The dog pounced upon it , and gulped it down greedily , and was just turning to go , when it staggered , fell , rolled over , and died .
Nur Mahomed , who had been lazily watching him , stood still for a moment , then he came back whistling softly .
He gathered up the rest of his dinner and carefully wrapped it up to carry away and bury somewhere ; and then he sent back the empty plates .
How furious the king was when , at the next morning's durbar , Nur Mahomed appeared before him fresh , alert and smiling as usual .
He was determined , however , to try once more , and bidding the young man come into his presence that evening , gave orders that he was to carry a secret despatch to the governor of a distant province .
` Make your preparations at once , ' added he , ` and be ready to start in the morning .
I myself will deliver you the papers at the last moment . '
Now this province was four or five days ' journey from the palace , and the governor of it was the most faithful servant the king had .
He could be silent as the grave , and prided himself on his obedience .
Whilst he was an old and tried servant of the king's , his wife had been almost a mother to the young princess ever since the queen had died some years before .
It happened that , a little before this time , the princess had been sent away for her health to another remote province ; and whilst she was there her old friend , the governor's wife , had begged her to come and stay with them as soon as she could .
The princess accepted gladly , and was actually staying in the governor's house at the very time when the king made up his mind to send Nur Mahomed there with the mysterious despatch .
According to orders Nur Mahomed presented himself early the next morning at the king's private apartments .
His best horse was saddled , food placed in is saddle-bag , and with some money tied up in his waist-band , he was ready to start .
The king handed over to him a sealed packet , desiring him to give it himself only into the hands of the governor , and to no one else .
Nur Mahomed hid it carefully in his turban , swung himself into the saddle , and five minutes later rode out of the city gates , and set out on his long journey .
The weather was very hot ; but Nur Mahomed thought that the sooner his precious letter was delivered the better ; so that , by dint of riding most of each night and resting only in the hottest part of the day , he found himself , by noon on the third day , approaching the town which was his final destination .
Not a soul was to be seen anywhere ; and Nur Mahomed , stiff , dry , thirsty , and tired , looked longingly over the wall into the gardens , and marked the fountains , the green grass , the shady apricot orchards , and giant mulberry trees , and wished he were there .
At length he reached the castle gates , and was at once admitted , as he was in the uniform of the king's bodyguard .
The governor was resting , the soldier said , and could not see him until the evening .
So Nur Mahomed handed over his horse to an attendant , and wandered down into the lovely gardens he had seen from the road , and sat down in the shade to rest himself .
He flung himself on his back and watched the birds twittering and chattering in the trees above him .
Through the branches he could see great patches of sky where the kites wheeled and circled incessantly , with shrill whistling cried .
Bees buzzed over the flowers with a soothing sound , and in a few minutes Nur Mahomed was fast asleep .
Every day , through the heat of the afternoon , the governor , and his wife also , used to lie down for two or three hours in their own rooms , and so , for the matter of that , did most people in the palace .
But the princess , like many other girls , was restless , and preferred to wander about the garden , rather than rest on a pile of soft cushions .
What a torment her stout old attendants and servants sometime thought her when she insisted on staying awake , and making them chatter or do something , when they could hardly keep their eyes open !
Sometimes , however , the princess would pretend to go to sleep , and then , after all her women had gladly followed her example , she would get up and go out by herself , her veil hanging loosely about her .
If she was discovered her old hostess scolded her severely ; but the princess only laughed , and did the same thing next time .
This very afternoon the princess had left all her women asleep , and , after trying in vain to amuse herself indoors , she had slipped out into the great garden , and rambled about in all her favourite nooks and corners , feeling quite safe as there was not a creature to be seen .
Suddenly , on turning a corner , she stopped in surprise , for before her lay a man fast asleep !
In her hurry she had almost tripped over him .
But there he was , a young man , tanned and dusty with travel , in the uniform of an officer of the king's guard .
One of the few faults of this lovely princess was a devouring curiosity , and she lived such an idle life that she had plenty of time to be curious .
Out of one of the folds of this young man's turban there peeped the corner of a letter !
She wondered what the letter was -- whom it was for !
She drew her veil a little closer , and stole across on tip-toe and caught hold of the corner of the letter .
Then she pulled it a little , and just a little more !
A great big seal came into view , which she saw to be her father's , and at the sight of it she paused for a minute half ashamed of what she was doing .
But the pleasure of taking a letter which was not meant for her was more than she could resist , and in another moment it was in her hand .
All at once she remembered that it would be death to this poor officer if he lost the letter , and that at all hazards she must put it back again .
But this was not so easy ; and , moreover , the letter in her hand burnt her with longing to read it , and see what was inside .
She examined the seal .
It was sticky with being exposed to the hot sun , and with a very little effort it parted from the paper .
The letter was open and she read it !
And this was what was written : ` Behead the messenger who brings this letter secretly and at once .
Ask no questions . '
The girl grew pale .
What a shame !
she thought .
SHE would not let a handsome young fellow like that be beheaded ; but how to prevent it was not quite clear at the moment .
Some plan must be invented , and she wished to lock herself in where no one could interrupt her , as might easily happen in the garden .
So she crept softly to her room , and took a piece of paper and wrote upon it : ` Marry the messenger who brings this letter to the princess openly at once .
Ask no questions . '
And even contrived to work the seals off the original letter and to fix them to this , so that no one could tell , unless they examined it closely , that it had ever been opened .
Then she slipped back , shaking with fear and excitement , to where the young officer still lay asleep , thrust the letter into the fold so his turban , and hurried back to her room .
It was done !
Late in the afternoon Nur Mahomed woke , and , making sure that the precious despatch was still safe , went off to get ready for his audience with the governor .
As soon as he was ushered into his presence he took the letter from his turban and placed it in the governor's hands according to orders .
When he had read it the governor was certainly a little astonished ; but he was told in the letter to ` ask no questions , ' and he knew how to obey orders .
He sent for his wife and told her to get the princess ready to be married at once .
` Nonsense ! '
said his wife , ` what in the world do you mean ? '
` These are the king's commands , ' he answered ; ` go and do as I bid you .
The letter says `` at once , '' and `` ask no questions . ''
The marriage , therefore , must take place this evening . '
In vain did his wife urge every objection ; the more she argued , the more determined was her husband . '
I know how to obey orders , ' he said , ` and these are as plain as the nose on my face ! '
So the princess was summoned , and , somewhat to their surprise , she seemed to take the news very calmly ; next Nur Mahomed was informed , and he was greatly startled , but of course he could but be delighted at the great and unexpected honour which he thought the king had done him .
Then all the castle was turned upside down ; and when the news spread in the town , THAT was turned upside down too .
Everybody ran everywhere , and tried to do everything at once ; and , in the middle of it all , the old governor went about with his hair standing on end , muttering something about ` obeying orders . '
And so the marriage was celebrated , and there was a great feast in the castle , and another in the soldiers ' barracks , and illuminations all over the town and in the beautiful gardens .
And all the people declared that such a wonderful sight had never been seen , and talked about it to the ends of their lives .
The next day the governor despatched the princess and her bridegroom to the king , with a troop of horsemen , splendidly dressed , and he sent a mounted messenger on before them , with a letter giving the account of the marriage to the king .
When the king got the governor's letter , he grew so red in the face that everyone thought he was going to have apoplexy .
They were all very anxious to know what had happened , but he rushed off and locked himself into a room , where he ramped and raved until he was tired .
Then , after awhile , he began to think he had better make the best of it , especially as the old governor had been clever enough to send him back his letter , and the king was pretty sure that this was in the princess's handwriting .
He was fond of his daughter , and though she had behaved badly , he did not wish to cut HER head off , and he did not want people to know the truth because it would make him look foolish .
In fact , the more he considered the matter , the more he felt that he would be wise to put a good face on it , and to let people suppose that he had really brought about the marriage of his own free will .
So , when the young couple arrived , the king received them with all state , and gave his son-in-law a province to govern .
Nur Mahomed soon proved himself as able and honourable a governor as he was a brave soldier ; and , when the old king died , he became king in his place , and reigned long and happily .
Nur Mahomed's old mother lived for a long time in her ` son's ' palace , and died in peace .
The princess , his wife , although she had got her husband by a trick , found that she could not trick HIM , and so she never tried , but busied herself in teaching her children and scolding her maids .
As for the old hermit , no trace of him was ever discovered ; but the cave is there , and the leaves lie thick in front of it unto this day .
