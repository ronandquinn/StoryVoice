Katherine Rangely was packing up .
Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer .
`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away .
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned won't know a soul here and he'll be horribly lonesome . ''
`` I'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly .
`` Oh , I know .
You 're a special Providence , Ede .
Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I'll introduce him .
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth won't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''
Then the talk drifted around to Edith's affairs .
She was engaged to a certain Sidney Keith , who was a professor in some college .
`` I don't expect to see much of Sidney this summer , '' said Edith .
`` He's writing another book .
He is so terribly addicted to literature . ''
`` How lovely , '' sighed Katherine , who had aspirations in that line herself .
`` If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy .
But Ned is so prosaic .
He doesn't care a rap for poetry , and he laughs when I enthuse .
It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up writing seriously .
He says women writers are an abomination on the face of the earth .
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous ? ''
`` He is very handsome , though , '' said Edith , with a glance at his photograph on Katherine's dressing table .
`` And that is what Sid is not .
He is rather distinguished looking , but as plain as he can possibly be . ''
Edith sighed .
She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover .
`` He has lovely eyes , '' said Katherine comfortingly , `` and handsome men are always vain .
Even Ned is .
I have to snub him regularly .
But I think you'll like him . ''
Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night .
He was a handsome off-handed young fellow , who seemed to admire Katherine immensely , and be a little afraid of her into the bargain .
`` Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away , '' she told him in their good-bye chat .
`` She is a dear girl -- you'll like her , I know .
It's really too bad I have to go away now , but it can't be helped . ''
`` I shall be awfully lonesome , '' grumbled Ned .
`` Don't you forget to write regularly , Kitty . ''
`` Of course I'll write , but for pity's sake , Ned , don't call me Kitty .
It sounds so childish .
Well , bye-bye , dear boy .
I'll be back in two months and then we'll have a lovely time . ''
* * * * * When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven .
Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty , but not every woman can live by scenery alone .
`` Aunt Elizabeth , '' said Katherine one day , `` does anybody ever die in Harbour Hill ?
Because it doesn't seem to me it would be any change for them if they did . ''
Aunt Elizabeth's only reply to this was a shocked look .
To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds , and this involved long tramps along the shore .
On one of these occasions she met with an adventure .
The place was a remote spot far up the shore .
Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings , tucked up her skirt , rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows , and was deep in the absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland .
She looked anything but dignified while so employed , but under the circumstances dignity did not matter .
Presently she heard a shout from the shore and , turning around in dismay , she beheld a man on the rocks behind her .
He was evidently shouting at her .
What on earth could the creature want ?
`` Come in , '' he called , gesticulating wildly .
`` You'll be in the bottomless pit in another moment if you don't look out . ''
`` He certainly must be a lunatic , '' said Katherine to herself , `` or else he's drunk .
What am I to do ? ''
`` Come in , I tell you , '' insisted the stranger .
`` What in the world do you mean by wading out to such a place ?
Why , it's madness . ''
Katherine's indignation got the better of her fear .
`` I do not think I am trespassing , '' she called back as icily as possible .
The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all .
He came down to the very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly .
He was dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles .
He did not look like a lunatic , and he did not seem to be drunk .
`` I implore you to come in , '' he said earnestly .
`` You must be standing on the very brink of the bottomless pit . ''
He is certainly off his balance , thought Katherine .
He must be some revivalist who has gone insane on one point .
I suppose I 'd better go in .
He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I don't .
She picked her steps carefully back with her precious specimens .
The stranger eyed her severely as she stepped on the rocks .
`` I should think you would have more sense than to risk your life in that fashion for a handful of seaweeds , '' he said .
`` I haven't the faintest idea what you mean , '' said Miss Rangely .
`` You don't look crazy , but you talk as if you were . ''
`` Do you mean to say you don't know that what the people hereabouts call the Bottomless Pit is situated right off that point -- the most dangerous spot along the whole coast ? ''
`` No , I didn't , '' said Katherine , horrified .
She remembered now that Aunt Elizabeth had warned her to be careful of some bad hole along shore , but she had not been paying much attention and had supposed it to be in quite another direction .
`` I am a stranger here . ''
`` Well , I hardly thought you 'd be foolish enough to be out there if you knew , '' said the other in mollified accents .
`` The place ought not to be left without warning , anyhow .
It is the most careless thing I ever heard of .
There is a big hole right off that point and nobody has ever been able to find the bottom of it .
A person who got into it would never be heard of again .
The rocks there form an eddy that sucks everything right down . ''
`` I am very grateful to you for calling me in , '' said Katherine humbly .
`` I had no idea I was in such danger . ''
`` You have a very fine bunch of seaweeds , I see , '' said the unknown .
But Katherine was in no mood to converse on seaweeds .
She suddenly realized what she must look like -- bare feet , draggled skirts , dripping arms .
And this creature whom she had taken for a lunatic was undoubtedly a gentleman .
Oh , if he would only go and give her a chance to put on her shoes and stockings !
Nothing seemed further from his intentions .
When Katherine had picked up the aforesaid articles and turned homeward , he walked beside her , still discoursing on seaweeds as eloquently as if he were commonly accustomed to walking with barefooted young women .
In spite of herself , Katherine couldn't help listening to him , for he managed to invest seaweeds with an absorbing interest .
She finally decided that as he didn't seem to mind her bare feet , she wouldn't either .
He knew so much about seaweeds that Katherine felt decidedly amateurish beside him .
He looked over her specimens and pointed out the valuable ones .
He explained the best method of preserving and mounting them , and told her of other and less dangerous places along the shore where she might get some new varieties .
When they came in sight of Harbour Hill , Katherine began to wonder what on earth she would do with him .
It wasn't exactly permissible to snub a man who had practically saved your life , but , on the other hand , the prospect of walking through the principal street of Harbour Hill barefooted and escorted by a scholarly looking gentleman discoursing on seaweeds was not to be calmly contemplated .
The unknown cut the Gordian knot himself .
He said that he must really go back or he would be late for dinner , lifted his hat politely , and departed .
Katherine waited until he was out of sight , then sat down on the sand and put on her shoes and stockings .
`` Who on earth can he be ? ''
she said to herself .
`` And where have I seen him before ?
There was certainly something familiar about his appearance .
He is very nice , but he must have thought me crazy .
I wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill . ''
The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith awaiting her .
`` I see Ned quite often , '' wrote the latter , `` and I think he is perfectly splendid .
You are a lucky girl , Kate .
But oh , do you know that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill , too , or at least quite near it ?
I had a letter from him yesterday .
He has gone down there to spend his vacation , because it is so quiet , and to finish up some horrid scientific book he is working at .
He's boarding at some little farmhouse up the shore .
I've written to him today to hunt you up and consider himself introduced to you .
I think you'll like him , for he's just your style . ''
Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith's card was brought up to her that evening and went down to meet him .
Her companion of the morning rose to meet her .
`` You ! ''
he said .
`` Yes , me , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically .
`` You didn't expect it , did you ?
I was sure I had seen you before -- only it wasn't you but your photograph . ''
When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to call again .
He did not fail to avail himself of it -- in fact , he became a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa .
Katherine wrote all about it to Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience .
They got on capitally together .
They went on long expeditions up shore after seaweeds , and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a collection of the Harbour Hill flora .
This involved more long , companionable expeditions .
Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor Keith found time to work on his book , but as he made no reference to the subject , neither did she .
Once in a while , when she had time to think of them , she wondered how Ned and Edith were getting on .
At first Edith's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him .
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''
She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and wasn't so dependent on her society , etc. .
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again .
`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine .
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm .
There didn't seem to be anything more to say .
One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home .
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy .
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye .
She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver .
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine's hair .
When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away .
`` Oh , Sidney , don't !
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness .
`` I know it would -- and Ned's too .
They must never know . ''
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door .
With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back .
`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly .
But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone .
* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening .
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting .
It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily .
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
`` Why , we didn't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''
`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair .
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
I can't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''
`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne .
`` Lie down on the bed and I'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily .
`` I didn't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''
After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly .
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily .
She would go down for a minute .
There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging .
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !
I couldn't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
`` It's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned's voice -- in a choked sort of a way .
`` Upon my word , Edith , I don't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''
`` You must , '' sobbed Edith .
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney's too .
We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether .
When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel .
`` How is your headache , dear ? ''
she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine .
`` Oh , it's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully .
`` Why didn't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I wasn't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''
Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks .
`` Katherine ! ''
`` Don't look so conscience stricken , my dear child .
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- couldn't help it -- but it's all over .
Oh , don't be angry with me ! ''
`` Angry ?
My dear , I 'm delighted . ''
`` Delighted ? ''
`` Yes , you dear goose .
Can't you guess , or must I tell you ?
Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''
`` Katherine ! ''
`` Yes , it's quite true .
And of course we made up our minds to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of duty and all that .
But now , thank goodness , there is no need of such wholesale immolation .
So just let's forgive each other . ''
`` Oh , '' sighed Edith happily , `` it is almost too good to be true . ''
`` It is really providentially ordered , isn't it ? ''
said Katherine .
`` Ned and I would never have got on together in the world , and you and Sidney would have bored each other to death .
As it is , there will be four perfectly happy people instead of four miserable ones .
I'll tell Ned so tomorrow . ''
