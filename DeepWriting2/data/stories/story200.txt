At the edge of a wood there lived an old man who had only one son , and one day he called the boy to him and said he wanted some corn ground , but the youth must be sure never to enter any mill where the miller was beardless .
The boy took the corn and set out , and before he had gone very far he saw a large mill in front of him , with a beardless man standing in the doorway .
` Good greeting , beardless one ! '
cried he .
` Good greeting , sonny , ' replied the man .
` Could I grind something here ? '
` Yes , certainly !
I will finish what I am doing and then you can grind as long as you like . '
But suddenly the boy remembered what his father had told him , and bade farewell to the man , and went further down the river , till he came to another mill , not knowing that as soon as his back was turned the beardless man had picked up a bag of corn and run hastily to the same mill before him .
When the boy reached the second mill , and saw a second beardless man sitting there , he did not stop , and walked on till he came to a third mill .
But this time also the beardless man had been too clever for him , and had arrived first by another road .
When it happened a fourth time the boy grew cross , and said to himself , ` It is no good going on ; there seems to be a beardless man in every mill ' ; and he took his sack from his back , and made up his mind to grind his corn where he was .
The beardless man finished grinding his own corn , and when he had done he said to the boy , who was beginning to grind his , ` Suppose , sonny , we make a cake of what you have there . '
Now the boy had been rather uneasy when he recollected his father's words , but he thought to himself , ` What is done can not be undone , ' and answered , ` Very well , so let it be . '
Then the beardless one got up , threw the flour into the tub , and made a hole in the middle , telling the boy to fetch some water from the river in his two hands , to mix the cake .
When the cake was ready for baking they put it on the fire , and covered it with hot ashes , till it was cooked through .
Then they leaned it up against the wall , for it was too big to go into a cupboard , and the beardless one said to the boy : ` Look here , sonny : if we share this cake we shall neither of us have enough .
Let us see who can tell the biggest lie , and the one who lies the best shall have the whole cake . '
The boy , not knowing what else to do , answered , ` All right ; you begin . '
So the beardless one began to lie with all his might , and when he was tired of inventing new lies the boy said to him , ` My good fellow , if THAT is all you can do it is not much !
Listen to me , and I will tell you a true story .
` In my youth , when I was an old man , we had a quantity of beehives .
Every morning when I got up I counted them over , and it was quite easy to number the bees , but I never could reckon the hives properly .
One day , as I was counting the bees , I discovered that my best bee was missing , and without losing a moment I saddled a cock and went out to look for him .
I traced him as far as the shore , and knew that he had crossed the sea , and that I must follow .
When I had reached the other side I found a man had harnessed my bee to a plough , and with his help was sowing millet seed . '
`` That is my bee ! ''
I shouted .
`` Where did you get him from ? '' '
`` Brother , '' replied the man , `` if he is yours , take him . ''
And he not only gave me back my bee , but a sack of millet seed into the bargain , because he had made use of my bee .
Then I put the bag on my shoulders , took the saddle from the cock , and placed it on the back of the bee , which I mounted , leading the cock by a string , so that he should have a rest .
As we were flying home over the sea one of the strings that held the bag of millet broke in two , and the sack dropped straight into the ocean .
It was quite lost , of course , and there was no use thinking about it , and by the time we were safe back again night had come .
I then got down from my bee , and let him loose , that he might get his supper , gave the cock some hay , and went to sleep myself .
But when I awoke with the sun what a scene met my eyes !
During the night wolves had come and had eaten my bee .
And honey lay ankle-deep in the valley and knee-deep on the hills .
Then I began to consider how I could best collect some , to take home with me .
` Now it happened that I had with me a small hatchet , and this I took to the wood , hoping to meet some animal which I could kill , whose skin I might turn into a bag .
As I entered the forest I saw two roe-deer hopping on one foot , so I slew them with a single blow , and made three bags from their skins , all of which I filled with honey and placed on the back of the cock .
At length I reached home , where I was told that my father had just been born , and that I must go at once to fetch some holy water to sprinkle him with .
As I went I turned over in my mind if there was no way for me to get back my millet seed , which had dropped into the sea , and when I arrived at the place with the holy water I saw the seed had fallen on fruitful soil , and was growing before my eyes .
And more than that , it was even cut by an invisible hand , and made into a cake .
` So I took the cake as well as the holy water , and was flying back with them over the sea , when there fell a great rain , and the sea was swollen , and swept away my millet cake .
Ah , how vexed I was at its loss when I was safe on earth again .
` Suddenly I remembered that my hair was very long .
If I stood it touched the ground , although if I was sitting it only reached my ears .
I seized a knife and cut off a large lock , which I plaited together , and when night came tied it into a knot , and prepared to use it for a pillow .
But what was I to do for a fire ?
A tinder box I had , but no wood .
Then it occurred to me that I had stuck a needle in my clothes , so I took the needle and split it in pieces , and lit it , then laid myself down by the fire and went to sleep .
But ill-luck still pursued me .
While I was sleeping a spark from the fire lighted on the hair , which was burnt up in a moment .
In despair I threw myself on the ground , and instantly sank in it as far as my waist .
I struggled to get out , but only fell in further ; so I ran to the house , seized a spade , dug myself out , and took home the holy water .
On the way I noticed that the ripe fields were full of reapers , and suddenly the air became so frightfully hot that the men dropped down in a faint .
Then I called to them , `` Why don't you bring out our mare , which is as tall as two days , and as broad as half a day , and make a shade for yourselves ? ''
My father heard what I said and jumped quickly on the mare , and the reapers worked with a will in the shadow , while I snatched up a wooden pail to bring them some water to drink .
When I got to the well everything was frozen hard , so in order to draw some water I had to take off my head and break the ice with it .
As I drew near them , carrying the water , the reapers all cried out , `` Why , what has become of your head ? ''
I put up my hand and discovered that I really had no head , and that I must have left it in the well .
I ran back to look for it , but found that meanwhile a fox which was passing by had pulled my head out of the water , and was tearing at my brains .
I stole cautiously up to him , and gave him such a kick that he uttered a loud scream , and let fall a parchment on which was written , `` The cake is mine , and the beardless one goes empty-handed . '' '
With these words the boy rose , took the cake , and went home , while the beardless one remained behind to swallow his disappointment .
