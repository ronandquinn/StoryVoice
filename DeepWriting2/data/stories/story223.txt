Once there was a king who had great riches , which , when he died , he divided among his three sons .
The two eldest of these lived in rioting and feasting , and thus wasted and squandered their father's wealth till nothing remained , and they found themselves in want and misery .
The youngest of the three sons , on the contrary , made good use of his portion .
He married a wife and soon they had a most beautiful daughter , for whom , when she was grown up , he caused a great palace to be built underground , and then killed the architect who had built it .
Next he shut up his daughter inside , and then sent heralds all over the world to make known that he who should find the king's daughter should have her to wife .
If he were not capable of finding her then he must die .
Many young men sought to discover her , but all perished in the attempt .
After many had met their death thus , there came a young man , beautiful to behold , and as clever as he was beautiful , who had a great desire to attempt the enterprise .
First he went to a herdsman , and begged him to hide him in a sheepskin , which had a golden fleece , and in this disguise to take him to the king .
The shepherd let himself be persuaded so to do , took a skin having a golden fleece , sewed the young man in it , putting in also food and drink , and so brought him before the king .
When the latter saw the golden lamb , he asked the herd : ` Will you sell me this lamb ? '
But the herd answered : ` No , oh king ; I will not sell it ; but if you find pleasure therein , I will be willing to oblige you , and I will lend it to you , free of charge , for three days , after that you must give it back to me . '
This the king agreed to do , and he arose and took the lamb to his daughter .
When he had led it into her palace , and through many rooms , he came to a shut door .
Then he called ` Open , Sartara Martara of the earth ! '
and the door opened of itself .
After that they went through many more rooms , and came to another closed door .
Again the king called out : ` Open , Sartara Martara of the earth ! '
and this door opened like the other , and they came into the apartment where the princess dwelt , the floor , walls , and roof of which were all of silver .
When the king had embraced the princess , he gave her the lamb , to her great joy .
She stroked it , caressed it , and played with it .
After a while the lamb got loose , which , when the princess saw , she said : ` See , father , the lamb is free . '
But the king answered : ` It is only a lamb , why should it not be free ? '
Then he left the lamb with the princess , and went his way .
In the night , however , the young man threw off the skin .
When the princess saw how beautiful he was , she fell in love with him , and asked him : ` Why did you come here disguised in a sheepskin like that ? '
Then he answered : ` When I saw how many people sought you , and could not find you , and lost their lives in so doing , I invented this trick , and so I am come safely to you . '
The princess exclaimed : ` You have done well so to do ; but you must know that your wager is not yet won , for my father will change me and my maidens into ducks , and will ask you , `` Which of these ducks is the princess ? ''
Then I will turn my head back , and with my bill will clean my wings , so that you may know me . '
When they had spent three days together , chatting and caressing one another , the herd came back to the king , and demanded his lamb .
Then the king went to his daughter to bring it away , which troubled the princess very much , for she said they had played so nicely together .
But the king said : ' I can not leave it with you , my daughter , for it is only lent to me . '
So he took it away with him , and gave it back to the shepherd .
Then the young man threw the skin from off him , and went to the king , saying : ` Sire , I am persuaded I can find your daughter . '
When the king saw how handsome he was , he said : ` My lad , I have pity on your youth .
This enterprise has already cost the lives of many , and will certainly be your death as well . '
But the young man answered , ' I accept your conditions , oh king ; I will either find her or lose my head . '
Thereupon he went before the king , who followed after him , till they came to the great door .
Then the young man said to the king : ` Speak the words that it may open . '
And the king answered : ` What are the words ?
Shall I say something like this : `` Shut ; shut ; shut '' ? '
` No , ' said he ; ` say `` Open , Sartara Martara of the earth . '' '
When the king had so said , the door opened of itself , and they went in , while the king gnawed his moustache in anger .
Then they came to the second door , where the same thing happened as at the first , and they went in and found the princess .
Then spoke the king and said : ` Yes , truly , you have found the princess .
Now I will turn her as well as all her maidens into ducks , and if you can guess which of these ducks is my daughter , then you shall have her to wife . '
And immediately the king changed all the maidens into ducks , and he drove them before the young man , and said : ` Now show me which is my daughter . '
Then the princess , according to their understanding , began to clean her wings with her bill , and the lad said : ` She who cleans her wings is the princess . '
Now the king could do nothing more but give her to the young man to wife , and they lived together in great joy and happiness .
