It is all settled at last , and in another week I shall have left Thrush Hill .
I am a little bit sorry and a great bit glad .
I am going to Montreal to spend the winter with Alicia .
Alicia -- it used to be plain Alice when she lived at Thrush Hill and made her own dresses and trimmed her own hats -- is my half-sister .
She is eight years older than I am .
We are both orphans , and Aunt Elizabeth brought us up here at Thrush Hill , the most delightful old country place in the world , half smothered in big willows and poplars , every one of which I have climbed in the early tomboy days of gingham pinafores and sun-bonnets .
When Alicia was eighteen she married Roger Gresham , a man of forty .
The world said that she married him for his money .
I dare say she did .
Alicia was tired of poverty .
I don't blame her .
Very likely I shall do the same thing one of these days , if I get the chance -- for I too am tired of poverty .
When Alicia went to Montreal she wanted to take me with her , but I wanted to be outdoors , romping in the hay or running wild in the woods with Jack .
Jack Willoughby -- Dr. John H. Willoughby , it reads on his office door -- was the son of our nearest neighbour .
We were chums always , and when he went away to college I was heartbroken .
The vacations were the only joy of my life then .
I don't know just when I began to notice a change in Jack , but when he came home two years ago , a full-fledged M.D. -- a great , tall , broad-shouldered fellow , with the sweetest moustache , and lovely thick black hair , just made for poking one's fingers through -- I realized it to the full .
Jack was grown up .
The dear old days of bird-nesting and nutting and coasting and fishing and general delightful goings-on were over forever .
I was sorry at first .
I wanted `` Jack . ''
`` Dr. Willoughby '' seemed too distinguished and far away .
I suppose he found a change in me , too .
I had put on long skirts and wore my hair up .
I had also found out that I had a complexion , and that sunburn was not becoming .
I honestly thought I looked pretty , but Jack surveyed me with decided disapprobation .
`` What have you done to yourself ?
You don't look like the same girl .
I 'd never know you in that rig-out , with all those flippery-trippery curls all over your head .
Why don't you comb your hair straight back , and let it hang in a braided tail , like you used to ? ''
This didn't suit me at all .
When I expect a compliment and get something quite different I always get snippy .
So I said , with what I intended to be crushing dignity , `` that I supposed I wasn't the same girl ; I had grown up , and if he didn't like my curls he needn't look at them .
For my part , I thought them infinitely preferable to that horrid , conceited-looking moustache he had grown . ''
`` I'll shave it off if it doesn't suit you , '' said Jack amiably .
Jack is always so provokingly good-humoured .
When you've taken pains and put yourself out -- even to the extent of fibbing about a moustache -- to exasperate a person , there is nothing more annoying than to have him keep perfectly angelic .
But after a while Jack and I adjusted ourselves to the change in each other and became very good friends again .
It was quite a different friendship from the old , but it was very pleasant .
Yes , it was ; I will admit that much .
I was provoked at Jack's determination to settle down for life in Valleyfield , a horrible , humdrum , little country village .
`` You'll never make your fortune there , Jack , '' I said spitefully .
`` You'll just be a poor , struggling country doctor all your life , and you'll be grey at forty . ''
`` I don't expect to make a fortune , Kitty , '' said Jack quietly .
`` Do you think that is the one desirable thing ?
I shall never be a rich man .
But riches are not the only thing that makes life pleasant . ''
`` Well , I think they have a good deal to do with it , anyhow , '' I retorted .
`` It's all very well to pretend to despise wealth , but it's generally a case of sour grapes .
I will own up honestly that I 'd love to be rich . ''
It always seems to make Jack blue and grumpy when I talk like that .
I suppose that is one reason why he never asked me to settle down in life as a country doctor's wife .
Another was , no doubt , that I always nipped his sentimental sproutings religiously in the bud .
Three weeks ago Alicia wrote to me , asking me to spend the winter with her .
Her letters always make me just gasp with longing for the life they describe .
Jack's face , when I told him about it , was so woebegone that I felt a stab of remorse , even in the heyday of my delight .
`` Do you really mean it , Kitty ?
Are you going away to leave me ? ''
`` You won't miss me much , '' I said flippantly -- I had a creepy , crawly presentiment that a scene of some kind was threatening -- `` and I 'm awfully tired of Thrush Hill and country life , Jack .
I suppose it is horribly ungrateful of me to say so , but it is the truth . ''
`` I shall miss you , '' he said soberly .
Somehow he had my hands in his .
How did he ever get them ?
I was sure I had them safely tucked out of harm's way behind me .
`` You know , Kitty , that I love you .
I am a poor man -- perhaps I may never be anything else -- and this may seem to you very presumptuous .
But I can not let you go like this .
Will you be my wife , dear ? ''
Wasn't it horribly straightforward and direct ?
So like Jack !
I tried to pull my hands away , but he held them fast .
There was nothing to do but answer him .
That `` no '' I had determined to say must be said , but , oh !
how woefully it did stick in my throat !
And I honestly believe that by the time I got it out it would have been transformed into a `` yes , '' in spite of me , had it not been for a certain paragraph in Alicia's letter which came providentially to my mind : Not to flatter you , Katherine , you are a beauty , my dear -- if your photo is to be trusted .
If you have not discovered that fact before -- how should you , indeed , in a place like Thrush Hill ?
-- you soon will in Montreal .
With your face and figure you will make a sensation .
There is to be a nephew of the Sinclairs here this winter .
He is an American , immensely wealthy , and will be the catch of the season .
A word to the wise , etc. .
Don't get into any foolish entanglement down there .
I have heard some gossip of you and our old playfellow , Jack Willoughby .
I hope it is nothing but gossip .
You can do better than that , Katherine .
That settled Jack's fate , if there ever had been any doubt .
`` Don't talk like that , Jack , '' I said hurriedly .
`` It is all nonsense .
I think a great deal of you as a friend and -- and -- all that , you know .
But I can never marry you . ''
`` Are you sure , Kitty ? ''
said Jack earnestly .
`` Don't you care for me at all ? ''
It was horrid of Jack to ask that question !
`` No , '' I said miserably , `` not -- not in that way , Jack .
Oh , don't ever say anything like this to me again . ''
He let go of my hands then , white to the lips .
`` Oh , don't look like that , Jack , '' I entreated .
`` I can't help it , '' he said in a low voice .
`` But I won't bother you again , dear .
It was foolish of me to expect -- to hope for anything of the sort .
You are a thousand times too good for me , I know . ''
`` Oh , indeed I 'm not , Jack , '' I protested .
`` If you knew how horrid I am , really , you 'd be glad and thankful for your escape .
Oh , Jack , I wish people never grew up . ''
Jack smiled sadly .
`` Don't feel badly over this , Kitty .
It isn't your fault .
Good night , dear . ''
He turned my face up and kissed me squarely on the mouth .
He had never kissed me since the summer before he went away to college .
Somehow it didn't seem a bit the same as it used to ; it was -- nicer now .
After he went away I came upstairs and had a good , comfortable howl .
Then I buried the whole affair decently .
I am not going to think of it any more .
I shall always have the highest esteem for Jack , and I hope he will soon find some nice girl who will make him happy .
Mary Carter would jump at him , I know .
To be sure , she is as homely as she can be and live .
But , then , Jack is always telling me how little he cares for beauty , so I have no doubt she will suit him admirably .
As for myself -- well , I am ambitious .
I don't suppose my ambition is a very lofty one , but such as it is I mean to hunt it down .
Come .
Let me put it down in black and white , once for all , and see how it looks : I mean to marry the rich nephew of the Sinclairs .
There !
It is out , and I feel better .
How mercenary and awful it looks written out in cold blood like that .
I wouldn't have Jack or Aunt Elizabeth -- dear , unworldly old soul -- see it for the world .
But I wouldn't mind Alicia .
Poor dear Jack !
* * * * * Montreal , Dec. 16 , 18 -- .
This is a nice way to keep a journal .
But the days when I could write regularly are gone by .
That was when I was at Thrush Hill .
I am having a simply divine time .
How in the world did I ever contrive to live at Thrush Hill ?
To be sure , I felt badly enough that day in October when I left it .
When the train left Valleyfield I just cried like a baby .
Alicia and Roger welcomed me very heartily , and after the first week of homesickness -- I shiver yet when I think of it -- was over , I settled down to my new life as if I had been born to it .
Alicia has a magnificent home and everything heart could wish for -- jewels , carriages , servants , opera boxes , and social position .
Roger is a model husband apparently .
I must also admit that he is a model brother-in-law .
I could feel Alicia looking me over critically the moment we met .
I trembled with suspense , but I was soon relieved .
`` Do you know , Katherine , I am glad to see that your photograph didn't flatter you .
Photographs so often do , I am positively surprised at the way you have developed , my dear ; you used to be such a scrawny little brown thing .
By the way , I hope there is nothing between you and Jack Willoughby ? ''
`` No , of course not , '' I answered hurriedly .
I had intended to tell Alicia all about Jack , but when it came to the point I couldn't .
`` I am glad of that , '' said Alicia , with a relieved air .
`` Of course , I've no doubt Jack is a good fellow enough .
He was a nice boy .
But he would not be a suitable husband for you , Katherine . ''
I knew that very well .
That was just why I had refused him .
But it made me wince to hear Alicia say it .
I instantly froze up -- Alicia says dignity is becoming to me -- and Jack's name has never been mentioned between us since .
I made my bow to society at an `` At Home '' which Alicia gave for that purpose .
She drilled me well beforehand , and I think I acquitted myself decently .
Charlie Vankleek , whose verdict makes or mars every debutante in his set , has approved of me .
He called me a beauty , and everybody now believes that I am one , and greets me accordingly .
I met Gus Sinclair at Mrs. Brompton's dinner .
Alicia declares it was a case of love at first sight .
If so , I must confess that it was all on one side .
Mr. Sinclair is undeniably ugly -- even Alicia has to admit that -- and can't hold a candle to Jack in point of looks , for Jack , poor boy , was handsome , if he were nothing else .
But , as Alicia does not fail to remind me , Mr. Sinclair's homeliness is well gilded .
Apart from his appearance , I really liked him very much .
He is a gentlemanly little fellow -- his head reaches about to my shoulder -- cultured and travelled , and can talk splendidly , which Jack never could .
He took me into dinner at Mrs. Brompton's , and was very attentive .
You may imagine how many angelic glances I received from the other candidates for his favour .
Since then I have been having the gayest time imaginable .
Dances , dinners , luncheons , afternoon teas , `` functions '' to no end , and all delightful .
Aunt Elizabeth writes to me , but I have never heard a word from Jack .
He seems to have forgotten my existence completely .
No doubt he has consoled himself with Mary Carter .
Well , that is all for the best , but I must say I did not think Jack could have forgotten me so soon or so absolutely .
Of course it does not make the least difference to me .
The Sinclairs and the Bromptons and the Curries are to dine here tonight .
I can see myself reflected in the long mirror before me , and I really think my appearance will satisfy even Gus Sinclair's critical eye .
I am pale , as usual , I never have any colour .
That used to be one of Jack's grievances .
He likes pink and white milkmaidish girls .
My `` magnificent pallor '' didn't suit him at all .
But , what is more to the purpose , it suits Gus Sinclair .
He admires the statuesque style .
* * * * * Montreal , Jan. 20 , 18 -- .
Here it is a whole month since my last entry .
I am sitting here decked out in `` gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls '' for Mrs. Currie's dance .
These few minutes , after I emerge from the hands of my maid and before the carriage is announced , are almost the only ones I ever have to myself .
I am having a good time still .
Somehow , though , it isn't as exciting as it used to be .
I 'm afraid I 'm very changeable .
I believe I must be homesick .
I 'd love to get a glimpse of dear old Thrush Hill and Aunt Elizabeth , and J -- but , no !
I will not write that .
Mr. Sinclair has not spoken yet , but there is no doubt that he soon will .
Of course , I shall accept him when he does , and I coolly told Alicia so when she just as coolly asked me what I meant to do .
`` Certainly , I shall marry him , '' I said crossly , for the subject always irritates me .
`` Haven't I been laying myself out all winter to catch him ?
That is the bold , naked truth , and ugly enough it is .
My dearly beloved sister , I mean to accept Mr. Sinclair , without any hesitation , whenever I get the chance . ''
`` I give you credit for more sense than to dream of doing anything else , '' said Alicia in relieved tones .
`` Katherine , you are a very lucky girl . ''
`` Because I am going to marry a rich man for his money ? ''
I said coldly .
Sometimes I get snippy with Alicia these days .
`` No , '' said my half-sister in an exasperated way .
`` Why will you persist in speaking in that way ?
You are very provoking .
It is not likely I would wish to see you throw yourself away on a poor man , and I 'm sure you must like Gus . ''
`` Oh , yes , I like him well enough , '' I said listlessly .
`` To be sure , I did think once , in my salad days , that liking wasn't quite all in an affair of this kind .
I was absurd enough to imagine that love had something to do with it . ''
`` Don't talk so nonsensically , '' said Alicia sharply .
`` Love !
Well , of course , you ought to love your husband , and you will .
He loves you enough , at all events . ''
`` Alicia , '' I said earnestly , looking her straight in the face and speaking bluntly enough to have satisfied even Jack's love of straightforwardness , `` you married for money and position , so people say .
Are you happy ? ''
For the first time that I remembered , Alicia blushed .
She was very angry .
`` Yes , I did marry for money , '' she said sharply , `` and I don't regret it .
Thank heaven , I never was a fool . ''
`` Don't be vexed , Alicia , '' I entreated .
`` I only asked because -- well , it is no matter . ''
* * * * * Montreal , Jan. 25 , 18 -- .
It is bedtime , but I am too excited and happy and miserable to sleep .
Jack has been here -- dear old Jack !
How glad I was to see him .
His coming was so unexpected .
I was sitting alone in my room this afternoon -- I believe I was moping -- when Bessie brought up his card .
I gave it one rapturous look and tore downstairs , passing Alicia in the hall like a whirlwind , and burst into the drawing-room in a most undignified way .
`` Jack ! ''
I cried , holding out both hands to him in welcome .
There he was , just the same old Jack , with his splendid big shoulders and his lovely brown eyes .
And his necktie was crooked , too ; as soon as I could get my hands free I put them up and straightened it out for him .
How nice and old-timey that was !
`` So you are glad to see me , Kitty ? ''
he said as he squeezed my hands in his big strong paws . ''
` Deed and ` deed I am , Jack .
I thought you had forgotten me altogether .
And I've been so homesick and so -- so everything , '' I said incoherently .
`` And , oh , Jack , I've so many questions to ask I don't know where to begin .
Tell me all the Thrush Hill and Valleyfield news , tell me everything that has happened since I left .
How many people have you killed off ?
And , oh , why didn't you come to see me before ? ''
`` I didn't think I should be wanted , Kitty , '' Jack answered quietly .
`` You seemed to be so absorbed in your new life that old friends and interests were crowded out . ''
`` So I was at first , '' I answered penitently .
`` I was dazzled , you know .
The glare was too much for my Thrush Hill brown .
But it's different now .
How did you happen to come , Jack ? ''
`` I had to come to Montreal on business , and I thought it would be too bad if I went back without coming to see what they had been doing in Vanity Fair to my little playmate . ''
`` Well , what do you think they have been doing ? ''
I asked saucily .
I had on a particularly fetching gown and knew I was looking my best .
Jack , however , looked me over with his head on one side .
`` Well , I don't know , Kitty , '' he said slowly .
`` That is a stunning sort of dress you have on -- not so pretty , though , as that old blue muslin you used to wear last summer -- and your hair is pretty good .
But you look rather disdainful and , after all , I believe I prefer Thrush Hill Kitty . ''
How like Jack that was .
He never thought me really pretty , and he is too honest to pretend he does .
But I didn't care .
I just laughed , and we sat down together and had a long , delightful , chummy talk .
Jack told me all the Valleyfield gossip , not forgetting to mention that Mary Carter was going to be married to a minister in June .
Jack didn't seem to mind it a bit , so I guess he couldn't have been particularly interested in Mary .
In due time Alicia sailed in .
I suppose she had found out from Bessie who my caller was , and felt rather worried over the length of our tête-à-tête .
She greeted Jack very graciously , but with a certain polite condescension of which she is past mistress .
I am sure Jack felt it , for , as soon as he decently could , he got up to go .
Alicia asked him to remain to dinner .
`` We are having a few friends to dine with us , but it is quite an informal affair , '' she said sweetly .
I felt that Jack glanced at me for the fraction of a second .
But I remembered that Gus Sinclair was coming too , and I did not look at him .
Then he declined quietly .
He had a business engagement , he said .
I suppose Alicia had noticed that look at me , for she showed her claws .
`` Don't forget to call any time you are in Montreal , '' she said more sweetly than ever .
`` I am sure Katherine will always be glad to see any of her old friends , although some of her new ones are proving very absorbing -- one , in especial .
Don't blush , Katherine , I am sure Mr. Willoughby won't tell any tales out of school to your old Valleyfield friends . ''
I was not blushing , and I was furious .
It was really too bad of Alicia , although I don't see why I need have cared .
Alicia kept her eye on us both until Jack was fairly gone .
Then she remarked in the patronizing tone which I detest : `` Really , Katherine , Jack Willoughby has developed into quite a passable-looking fellow , although he is rather shabby .
But I suppose he is poor . ''
`` Yes , '' I answered curtly , `` he is poor , in everything except youth and manhood and goodness and truth !
But I suppose those don't count for anything . ''
Whereupon Alicia lifted her eyebrows and looked me over .
Just at dusk a box arrived with Jack's compliments .
It was full of lovely white carnations , and must have cost the extravagant fellow more than he has any business to waste on flowers .
I was beast enough to put them on when I went down to listen to another man's love-making .
This evening I sparkled and scintillated with unusual brilliancy , for Jack's visit and my consequent crossing of swords with Alicia had produced a certain elation of spirits .
When Gus Sinclair was leaving he asked if he might see me alone tomorrow afternoon .
I knew what that meant , and a cold shiver went up and down my backbone .
But I looked down at him -- spick-and-span and glossy -- his neckties are never crooked -- and said , yes , he might come at three o'clock .
Alicia had noticed our aside -- when did anything ever escape her ?
-- and when he was gone she asked , significantly , what secret he had been telling me .
`` He wants to see me alone tomorrow afternoon .
I suppose you know what that means , Alicia ? ''
`` Ah , '' purred Alicia , `` I congratulate you , my dear . ''
`` Aren't your congratulations a little premature ? ''
I asked coldly .
`` I haven't accepted him yet . ''
`` But you will ? ''
`` Oh , certainly .
Isn't it what we've schemed and angled for ?
I 'm very well satisfied . ''
And so I am .
But I wish it hadn't come so soon after Jack's visit , because I feel rather upset yet .
Of course I like Gus Sinclair very much , and I am sure I shall be very fond of him .
Well , I must go to bed now and get my beauty sleep .
I don't want to be haggard and hollow-eyed at that important interview tomorrow -- an interview that will decide my destiny .
* * * * * Thrush Hill , May 6 , 18 -- .
Well , it did decide it , but not exactly in the way I anticipated .
I can look back on the whole affair quite calmly now , but I wouldn't live it over again for all the wealth of Ind. .
That day when Gus Sinclair came I was all ready for him .
I had put on my very prettiest new gown to do honour to the occasion , and Alicia smilingly assured me I was looking very well .
`` And so cool and composed .
Will you be able to keep that up ?
Don't you really feel a little nervous , Katherine ? ''
`` Not in the least , '' I said .
`` I suppose I ought to be , according to traditions , but I never felt less flustered in my life . ''
When Bessie brought up Gus Sinclair's card Alicia dropped a pecky little kiss on my cheek , and pushed me toward the door .
I went down calmly , although I'll admit that my heart was beating wildly .
Gus Sinclair was plainly nervous , but I was composed enough for both .
You would really have thought that I was in the habit of being proposed to by a millionaire every day .
`` I suppose you know what I have come to say , '' he said , standing before me , as I leaned gracefully back in a big chair , having taken care that the folds of my dress fell just as they should .
And then he proceeded to say it in a rather jumbled-up fashion , but very sincerely .
I remember thinking at the time that he must have composed the speech in his head the night before , and rehearsed it several times , but was forgetting it in spots .
When he ended with the self-same question that Jack had asked me three months before at Thrush Hill he stopped and took my hands .
I looked up at him .
His good , homely face was close to mine , and in his eyes was an unmistakable look of love and tenderness .
I opened my mouth to say yes .
And then there came over me in one rush the most awful realization of the sacrilege I was going to commit .
I forgot everything except that I loved Jack Willoughby , and that I could never , never marry anybody in the world except him .
Then I pulled my hands away and burst into hysterical , undignified tears .
`` I beg your pardon , '' said Mr. Sinclair .
`` I did not mean to startle you .
Have I been too abrupt ?
Surely you must have known -- you must have expected -- '' `` Yes -- yes -- I knew , '' I cried miserably , `` and I intended right up to this very minute to marry you .
I 'm so sorry -- but I can't -- I can't . ''
`` I don't understand , '' he said in a bewildered tone .
`` If you expected it , then why -- why -- don't you care for me ? ''
`` No , that's just it , '' I sobbed .
`` I don't love you at all -- and I do love somebody else .
But he is poor , and I hate poverty .
So I refused him , and I meant to marry you just because you are rich . ''
Such a pained look came over his face .
`` I did not think this of you , '' he said in a low tone .
`` Oh , I know I have acted shamefully , '' I said .
`` You can't think any worse of me than I do of myself .
How you must despise me ! ''
`` No , '' he said , with a grim smile , `` if I did it would be easier for me .
I might not love you then .
Don't distress yourself , Katherine .
I do not deny that I feel greatly hurt and disappointed , but I am glad you have been true to yourself at last .
Don't cry , dear . ''
`` You 're very good , '' I answered disconsolately , `` but all the same the fact remains that I have behaved disgracefully to you , and I know you think so .
Oh , Mr. Sinclair , please , please , go away .
I feel so miserably ashamed of myself that I can not look you in the face . ''
`` I am going , dear , '' he said gently .
`` I know all this must be very painful to you , but it is not easy for me , either . ''
`` Can you forgive me ? ''
I said wistfully .
`` Yes , my dear , completely .
Do not let yourself be unhappy over this .
Remember that I will always be your friend .
Goodbye . ''
He held out his hand and gave mine an earnest clasp .
Then he went away .
I remained in the drawing-room , partly because I wanted to finish out my cry , and partly because , miserable coward that I was , I didn't dare face Alicia .
Finally she came in , her face wreathed with anticipatory smiles .
But when her eyes fell on my forlorn , crumpled self she fairly jumped .
`` Katherine , what is the matter ? ''
she asked sharply .
`` Didn't Mr. Sinclair -- '' `` Yes , he did , '' I said desperately .
`` And I've refused him .
There now , Alicia ! ''
Then I waited for the storm to burst .
It didn't all at once .
The shock was too great , and at first quite paralyzed my half-sister .
`` Katherine , '' she gasped , `` are you crazy ?
Have you lost your senses ? ''
`` No , I've just come to them .
It's true enough , Alicia .
You can scold all you like .
I know I deserve it , and I won't flinch .
I did really intend to take him , but when it came to the point I couldn't .
I didn't love him . ''
Then , indeed , the storm burst .
I never saw Alicia so angry before , and I never got so roundly abused .
But even Alicia has her limits , and at last she grew calmer .
`` You have behaved disgracefully , '' she concluded .
`` I am disgusted with you .
You have encouraged Gus Sinclair markedly right along , and now you throw him over like this .
I never dreamed that you were capable of such unwomanly behaviour . ''
`` That's a hard word , Alicia , '' I protested feebly .
She dealt me a withering glance .
`` It does not begin to be as hard as your shameful conduct merits .
To think of losing a fortune like that for the sake of sentimental folly !
I didn't think you were such a consummate fool . ''
`` I suppose you absorbed all the sense of our family , '' I said drearily .
`` There now , Alicia , do leave me alone .
I 'm down in the very depths already . ''
`` What do you mean to do now ? ''
said Alicia scornfully .
`` Go back to Valleyfield and marry that starving country doctor of yours , I suppose ? ''
I flared up then ; Alicia might abuse me all she liked , but I wasn't going to hear a word against Jack .
`` Yes , I will , if he'll have me , '' I said , and I marched out of the room and upstairs , with my head very high .
Of course I decided to leave Montreal as soon as I could .
But I couldn't get away within a week , and it was a very unpleasant one .
Alicia treated me with icy indifference , and I knew I should never be reinstated in her good graces .
To my surprise , Roger took my part .
`` Let the girl alone , '' he told Alicia .
`` If she doesn't love Sinclair , she was right in refusing him .
I , for one , am glad that she has got enough truth and womanliness in her to keep her from selling herself . ''
Then he came to the library where I was moping , and laid his hand on my head .
`` Little girl , '' he said earnestly , `` no matter what anyone says to you , never marry a man for his money or for any other reason on earth except because you love him . ''
This comforted me greatly , and I did not cry myself to sleep that night as usual .
At last I got away .
I had telegraphed to Jack : `` Am coming home Wednesday ; meet me at train , '' and I knew he would be there .
How I longed to see him again -- dear , old , badly treated Jack .
I got to Valleyfield just at dusk .
It was a rainy evening , and everything was slush and fog and gloom .
But away up I saw the home light at Thrush Hill , and Jack was waiting for me on the platform .
`` Oh , Jack ! ''
I said , clinging to him , regardless of appearances .
`` Oh , I 'm so glad to be back . ''
`` That's right , Kitty .
I knew you wouldn't forget us .
How well you are looking ! ''
`` I suppose I ought to be looking wretched , '' I said penitently .
`` I've been behaving very badly , Jack .
Wait till we get away from the crowd and I'll tell you all about it . ''
And I did .
I didn't gloss over anything , but just confessed the whole truth .
Jack heard me through in silence , and then he kissed me .
`` Can you forgive me , Jack , and take me back ? ''
I whispered , cuddling up to him .
And he said -- but , on second thought , I will not write down what he said .
We are to be married in June .
