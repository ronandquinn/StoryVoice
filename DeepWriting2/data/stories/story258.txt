IN a quiet , pleasant meadow , Beneath a summer sky , Where green old trees their branches waved , And winds went singing by ; Where a little brook went rippling So musically low , And passing clouds cast shadows On the waving grass below ; Where low , sweet notes of brooding birds Stole out on the fragrant air , And golden sunlight shone undimmed On all most fresh and fair ; -- There bloomed a lovely sisterhood Of happy little flowers , Together in this pleasant home , Through quiet summer hours .
No rude hand came to gather them , No chilling winds to blight ; Warm sunbeams smiled on them by day , And soft dews fell at night .
So here , along the brook-side , Beneath the green old trees , The flowers dwelt among their friends , The sunbeams and the breeze .
One morning , as the flowers awoke , Fragrant , and fresh , and fair , A little worm came creeping by , And begged a shelter there .
`` Ah !
pity and love me , '' sighed the worm , `` I am lonely , poor , and weak ; A little spot for a resting-place , Dear flowers , is all I seek .
I am not fair , and have dwelt unloved By butterfly , bird , and bee .
They little knew that in this dark form Lay the beauty they yet may see .
Then let me lie in the deep green moss , And weave my little tomb , And sleep my long , unbroken sleep Till Spring's first flowers come .
Then will I come in a fairer dress , And your gentle care repay By the grateful love of the humble worm ; Kind flowers , O let me stay ! ''
But the wild rose showed her little thorns , While her soft face glowed with pride ; The violet hid beneath the drooping ferns , And the daisy turned aside .
Little Houstonia scornfully laughed , As she danced on her slender stem ; While the cowslip bent to the rippling waves , And whispered the tale to them .
A blue-eyed grass looked down on the worm , As it silently turned away , And cried , `` Thou wilt harm our delicate leaves , And therefore thou canst not stay . ''
Then a sweet , soft voice , called out from far , `` Come hither , poor worm , to me ; The sun lies warm in this quiet spot , And I'll share my home with thee . ''
The wondering flowers looked up to see Who had offered the worm a home : ' T was a clover-blossom , whose fluttering leaves Seemed beckoning him to come ; It dwelt in a sunny little nook , Where cool winds rustled by , And murmuring bees and butterflies came , On the flower's breast to lie .
Down through the leaves the sunlight stole , And seemed to linger there , As if it loved to brighten the home Of one so sweet and fair .
Its rosy face smiled kindly down , As the friendless worm drew near ; And its low voice , softly whispering , said `` Poor thing , thou art welcome here ; Close at my side , in the soft green moss , Thou wilt find a quiet bed , Where thou canst softly sleep till Spring , With my leaves above thee spread .
I pity and love thee , friendless worm , Though thou art not graceful or fair ; For many a dark , unlovely form , Hath a kind heart dwelling there ; No more o'er the green and pleasant earth , Lonely and poor , shalt thou roam , For a loving friend hast thou found in me , And rest in my little home . ''
Then , deep in its quiet mossy bed , Sheltered from sun and shower , The grateful worm spun its winter tomb , In the shadow of the flower .
And Clover guarded well its rest , Till Autumn's leaves were sere , Till all her sister flowers were gone , And her winter sleep drew near .
Then her withered leaves were softly spread O'er the sleeping worm below , Ere the faithful little flower lay Beneath the winter snow .
Spring came again , and the flowers rose From their quiet winter graves , And gayly danced on their slender stems , And sang with the rippling waves .
Softly the warm winds kissed their cheeks ; Brightly the sunbeams fell , As , one by one , they came again In their summer homes to dwell .
And little Clover bloomed once more , Rosy , and sweet , and fair , And patiently watched by the mossy bed , For the worm still slumbered there .
Then her sister flowers scornfully cried , As they waved in the summer air , `` The ugly worm was friendless and poor ; Little Clover , why shouldst thou care ?
Then watch no more , nor dwell alone , Away from thy sister flowers ; Come , dance and feast , and spend with us These pleasant summer hours .
We pity thee , foolish little flower , To trust what the false worm said ; He will not come in a fairer dress , For he lies in the green moss dead . ''
But little Clover still watched on , Alone in her sunny home ; She did not doubt the poor worm's truth , And trusted he would come .
At last the small cell opened wide , And a glittering butterfly , From out the moss , on golden wings , Soared up to the sunny sky .
Then the wondering flowers cried aloud , `` Clover , thy watch was vain ; He only sought a shelter here , And never will come again . ''
And the unkind flowers danced for joy , When they saw him thus depart ; For the love of a beautiful butterfly Is dear to a flower's heart .
They feared he would stay in Clover's home , And her tender care repay ; So they danced for joy , when at last he rose And silently flew away .
Then little Clover bowed her head , While her soft tears fell like dew ; For her gentle heart was grieved , to find That her sisters ' words were true , And the insect she had watched so long When helpless , poor , and lone , Thankless for all her faithful care , On his golden wings had flown .
But as she drooped , in silent grief , She heard little Daisy cry , `` O sisters , look !
I see him now , Afar in the sunny sky ; He is floating back from Cloud-Land now , Borne by the fragrant air .
Spread wide your leaves , that he may choose The flower he deems most fair . ''
Then the wild rose glowed with a deeper blush , As she proudly waved on her stem ; The Cowslip bent to the clear blue waves , And made her mirror of them .
Little Houstonia merrily danced , And spread her white leaves wide ; While Daisy whispered her joy and hope , As she stood by her gay friends ' side .
Violet peeped from the tall green ferns , And lifted her soft blue eye To watch the glittering form , that shone Afar in the summer sky .
They thought no more of the ugly worm , Who once had wakened their scorn ; But looked and longed for the butterfly now , As the soft wind bore him on .
Nearer and nearer the bright form came , And fairer the blossoms grew ; Each welcomed him , in her sweetest tones ; Each offered her honey and dew .
But in vain did they beckon , and smile , and call , And wider their leaves unclose ; The glittering form still floated on , By Violet , Daisy , and Rose .
Lightly it flew to the pleasant home Of the flower most truly fair , On Clover's breast he softly lit , And folded his bright wings there .
`` Dear flower , '' the butterfly whispered low , `` Long hast thou waited for me ; Now I am come , and my grateful love Shall brighten thy home for thee ; Thou hast loved and cared for me , when alone , Hast watched o'er me long and well ; And now will I strive to show the thanks The poor worm could not tell .
Sunbeam and breeze shall come to thee , And the coolest dews that fall ; Whate'er a flower can wish is thine , For thou art worthy all .
And the home thou shared with the friendless worm The butterfly's home shall be ; And thou shalt find , dear , faithful flower , A loving friend in me . ''
Then , through the long , bright summer hours Through sunshine and through shower , Together in their happy home Dwelt butterfly and flower .
`` Ah , that is very lovely , '' cried the Elves , gathering round little Sunbeam as she ceased , to place a garland in her hair and praise her song .
`` Now , '' said the Queen , `` call hither Moon-light and Summer-Wind , for they have seen many pleasant things in their long wanderings , and will gladly tell us them . ''
`` Most joyfully will we do our best , dear Queen , '' said the Elves , as they folded their wings beside her .
`` Now , Summer-Wind , '' said Moonlight , `` till your turn comes , do you sit here and fan me while I tell this tale of .
