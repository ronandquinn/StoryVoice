It is a great mistake to think that fairies , witches , magicians , and such people lived only in Eastern countries and in such times as those of the Caliph Haroun Al-Raschid .
Fairies and their like belong to every country and every age , and no doubt we should see plenty of them now -- if we only knew how .
In a large town in Germany there lived , some couple of hundred years ago , a cobbler and his wife .
They were poor and hard-working .
The man sat all day in a little stall at the street corner and mended any shoes that were brought him .
His wife sold the fruit and vegetables they grew in their garden in the Market Place , and as she was always neat and clean and her goods were temptingly spread out she had plenty of customers .
The couple had one boy called Jem .
A handsome , pleasant-faced boy of twelve , and tall for his age .
He used to sit by his mother in the market and would carry home what people bought from her , for which they often gave him a pretty flower , or a slice of cake , or even some small coin .
One day Jem and his mother sat as usual in the Market Place with plenty of nice herbs and vegetables spread out on the board , and in some smaller baskets early pears , apples , and apricots .
Jem cried his wares at the top of his voice : ` This way , gentlemen !
See these lovely cabbages and these fresh herbs !
Early apples , ladies ; early pears and apricots , and all cheap .
Come , buy , buy ! '
As he cried an old woman came across the Market Place .
She looked very torn and ragged , and had a small sharp face , all wrinkled , with red eyes , and a thin hooked nose which nearly met her chin .
She leant on a tall stick and limped and shuffled and stumbled along as if she were going to fall on her nose at any moment .
In this fashion she came along till she got to the stall where Jem and his mother were , and there she stopped .
` Are you Hannah the herb seller ? '
she asked in a croaky voice as her head shook to and fro .
` Yes , I am , ' was the answer .
` Can I serve you ? '
` We'll see ; we'll see !
Let me look at those herbs .
I wonder if you've got what I want , ' said the old woman as she thrust a pair of hideous brown hands into the herb basket , and began turning over all the neatly packed herbs with her skinny fingers , often holding them up to her nose and sniffing at them .
The cobbler's wife felt much disgusted at seeing her wares treated like this , but she dared not speak .
When the old hag had turned over the whole basket she muttered , ` Bad stuff , bad stuff ; much better fifty years ago -- all bad . '
This made Jem very angry ` You are a very rude old woman , ' he cried out .
` First you mess all our nice herbs about with your horrid brown fingers and sniff at them with your long nose till no one else will care to buy them , and then you say it's all bad stuff , though the duke's cook himself buys all his herbs from us . '
The old woman looked sharply at the saucy boy , laughed unpleasantly , and said : ` So you don't like my long nose , sonny ?
Well , you shall have one yourself , right down to your chin . '
As she spoke she shuffled towards the hamper of cabbages , took up one after another , squeezed them hard , and threw them back , muttering again , ` Bad stuff , bad stuff . '
` Don't waggle your head in that horrid way , ' begged Jem anxiously .
` Your neck is as thin as a cabbage-stalk , and it might easily break and your head fall into the basket , and then who would buy anything ? '
` Don't you like thin necks ? '
laughed the old woman .
` Then you sha n't have any , but a head stuck close between your shoulders so that it may be quite sure not to fall off . '
` Don't talk such nonsense to the child , ' said the mother at last .
` If you wish to buy , please make haste , as you are keeping other customers away . '
` Very well , I will do as you ask , ' said the old woman , with an angry look . '
I will buy these six cabbages , but , as you see , I can only walk with my stick and can carry nothing .
Let your boy carry them home for me and I'll pay him for his trouble . '
The little fellow didn't like this , and began to cry , for he was afraid of the old woman , but his mother ordered him to go , for she thought it wrong not to help such a weakly old creature ; so , still crying , he gathered the cabbages into a basket and followed the old woman across the Market Place .
It took her more than half an hour to get to a distant part of the little town , but at last she stopped in front of a small tumble-down house .
She drew a rusty old hook from her pocket and stuck it into a little hole in the door , which suddenly flew open .
How surprised Jem was when they went in !
The house was splendidly furnished , the walls and ceiling of marble , the furniture of ebony inlaid with gold and precious stones , the floor of such smooth slippery glass that the little fellow tumbled down more than once .
The old woman took out a silver whistle and blew it till the sound rang through the house .
Immediately a lot of guinea pigs came running down the stairs , but Jem thought it rather odd that they all walked on their hind legs , wore nutshells for shoes , and men's clothes , whilst even their hats were put on in the newest fashion .
` Where are my slippers , lazy crew ? '
cried the old woman , and hit about with her stick .
` How long am I to stand waiting here ? '
They rushed upstairs again and returned with a pair of cocoa nuts lined with leather , which she put on her feet .
Now all limping and shuffling was at an end .
She threw away her stick and walked briskly across the glass floor , drawing little Jem after her .
At last she paused in a room which looked almost like a kitchen , it was so full of pots and pans , but the tables were of mahogany and the sofas and chairs covered with the richest stuffs .
` Sit down , ' said the old woman pleasantly , and she pushed Jem into a corner of a sofa and put a table close in front of him .
` Sit down , you've had a long walk and a heavy load to carry , and I must give you something for your trouble .
Wait a bit , and I'll give you some nice soup , which you'll remember as long as you live . '
So saying , she whistled again .
First came in guinea pigs in men's clothing .
They had tied on large kitchen aprons , and in their belts were stuck carving knives and sauce ladles and such things .
After them hopped in a number of squirrels .
They too walked on their hind legs , wore full Turkish trousers , and little green velvet caps on their heads .
They seemed to be the scullions , for they clambered up the walls and brought down pots and pans , eggs , flour , butter , and herbs , which they carried to the stove .
Here the old woman was bustling about , and Jem could see that she was cooking something very special for him .
At last the broth began to bubble and boil , and she drew off the saucepan and poured its contents into a silver bowl , which she set before Jem .
` There , my boy , ' said she , ` eat this soup and then you'll have everything which pleased you so much about me .
And you shall be a clever cook too , but the real herb -- no , the REAL herb you'll never find .
Why had your mother not got it in her basket ? '
The child could not think what she was talking about , but he quite understood the soup , which tasted most delicious .
His mother had often given him nice things , but nothing had ever seemed so good as this .
The smell of the herbs and spices rose from the bowl , and the soup tasted both sweet and sharp at the same time , and was very strong .
As he was finishing it the guinea pigs lit some Arabian incense , which gradually filled the room with clouds of blue vapour .
They grew thicker and thicker and the scent nearly overpowered the boy .
He reminded himself that he must get back to his mother , but whenever he tried to rouse himself to go he sank back again drowsily , and at last he fell sound asleep in the corner of the sofa .
Strange dreams came to him .
He thought the old woman took off all his clothes and wrapped him up in a squirrel skin , and that he went about with the other squirrels and guinea pigs , who were all very pleasant and well mannered , and waited on the old woman .
First he learned to clean her cocoa-nut shoes with oil and to rub them up .
Then he learnt to catch the little sun moths and rub them through the finest sieves , and the flour from them he made into soft bread for the toothless old woman .
In this way he passed from one kind of service to another , spending a year in each , till in the fourth year he was promoted to the kitchen .
Here he worked his way up from under-scullion to head-pastrycook , and reached the greatest perfection .
He could make all the most difficult dishes , and two hundred different kinds of patties , soup flavoured with every sort of herb -- he had learnt it all , and learnt it well and quickly .
When he had lived seven years with the old woman she ordered him one day , as she was going out , to kill and pluck a chicken , stuff it with herbs , and have it very nicely roasted by the time she got back .
He did this quite according to rule .
He wrung the chicken's neck , plunged it into boiling water , carefully plucked out all the feathers , and rubbed the skin nice and smooth .
Then he went to fetch the herbs to stuff it with .
In the store-room he noticed a half-opened cupboard which he did not remember having seen before .
He peeped in and saw a lot of baskets from which came a strong and pleasant smell .
He opened one and found a very uncommon herb in it .
The stems and leaves were a bluish green , and above them was a little flower of a deep bright red , edged with yellow .
He gazed at the flower , smelt it , and found it gave the same strong strange perfume which came from the soup the old woman had made him .
But the smell was so sharp that he began to sneeze again and again , and at last -- he woke up !
There he lay on the old woman's sofa and stared about him in surprise .
` Well , what odd dreams one does have to be sure ! '
he said to himself .
` Why , I could have sworn I had been a squirrel , a companion of guinea pigs and such creatures , and had become a great cook , too .
How mother will laugh when I tell her !
But won't she scold me , though , for sleeping away here in a strange house , instead of helping her at market ! '
He jumped up and prepared to go : all his limbs still seemed quite stiff with his long sleep , especially his neck , for he could not move his head easily , and he laughed at his own stupidity at being still so drowsy that he kept knocking his nose against the wall or cupboards .
The squirrels and guinea pigs ran whimpering after him , as though they would like to go too , and he begged them to come when he reached the door , but they all turned and ran quickly back into the house again .
The part of the town was out of the way , and Jem did not know the many narrow streets in it and was puzzled by their windings and by the crowd of people , who seemed excited about some show .
From what he heard , he fancied they were going to see a dwarf , for he heard them call out : ` Just look at the ugly dwarf ! '
` What a long nose he has , and see how his head is stuck in between his shoulders , and only look at his ugly brown hands ! '
If he had not been in such a hurry to get back to his mother , he would have gone too , for he loved shows with giants and dwarfs and the like .
He was quite puzzled when he reached the market-place .
There sat his mother , with a good deal of fruit still in her baskets , so he felt he could not have slept so very long , but it struck him that she was sad , for she did not call to the passers-by , but sat with her head resting on her hand , and as he came nearer he thought she looked paler than usual .
He hesitated what to do , but at last he slipped behind her , laid a hand on her arm , and said : ` Mammy , what's the matter ?
Are you angry with me ? '
She turned round quickly and jumped up with a cry of horror .
` What do you want , you hideous dwarf ? '
she cried ; ` get away ; I can't bear such tricks . '
` But , mother dear , what's the matter with you ? '
repeated Jem , quite frightened .
` You can't be well .
Why do you want to drive your son away ? ' '
I have said already , get away , ' replied Hannah , quite angrily .
` You won't get anything out of me by your games , you monstrosity . '
` Oh dear , oh dear !
she must be wandering in her mind , ' murmured the lad to himself .
` How can I manage to get her home ?
Dearest mother , do look at me close .
Can't you see I am your own son Jem ? '
` Well , did you ever hear such impudence ? '
asked Hannah , turning to a neighbour .
` Just see that frightful dwarf -- would you believe that he wants me to think he is my son Jem ? '
Then all the market women came round and talked all together and scolded as hard as they could , and said what a shame it was to make game of Mrs. Hannah , who had never got over the loss of her beautiful boy , who had been stolen from her seven years ago , and they threatened to fall upon Jem and scratch him well if he did not go away at once .
Poor Jem did not know what to make of it all .
He was sure he had gone to market with his mother only that morning , had helped to set out the stall , had gone to the old woman's house , where he had some soup and a little nap , and now , when he came back , they were all talking of seven years .
And they called him a horrid dwarf !
Why , what had happened to him ?
When he found that his mother would really have nothing to do with him he turned away with tears in his eyes , and went sadly down the street towards his father's stall .
` Now I'll see whether he will know me , ' thought he .
` I'll stand by the door and talk to him . '
When he got to the stall he stood in the doorway and looked in .
The cobbler was so busy at work that he did not see him for some time , but , happening to look up , he caught sight of his visitor , and letting shoes , thread , and everything fall to the ground , he cried with horror : ` Good heavens !
what is that ? '
` Good evening , master , ' said the boy , as he stepped in .
` How do you do ? '
` Very ill , little sir , replied the father , to Jem's surprise , for he did not seem to know him .
` Business does not go well .
I am all alone , and am getting old , and a workman is costly . '
` But haven't you a son who could learn your trade by degrees ? '
asked Jem . '
I had one : he was called Jem , and would have been a tall sturdy lad of twenty by this time , and able to help me well .
Why , when he was only twelve he was quite sharp and quick , and had learnt many little things , and a good-looking boy too , and pleasant , so that customers were taken by him .
Well , well !
so goes the world ! '
` But where is your son ? '
asked Jem , with a trembling voice .
` Heaven only knows ! '
replied the man ; ` seven years ago he was stolen from the market-place , and we have heard no more of him . '
` SEVEN YEARS AGO ! '
cried Jem , with horror .
` Yes , indeed , seven years ago , though it seems but yesterday that my wife came back howling and crying , and saying the child had not come back all day .
I always thought and said that something of the kind would happen .
Jem was a beautiful boy , and everyone made much of him , and my wife was so proud of him , and liked him to carry the vegetables and things to grand folks ' houses , where he was petted and made much of .
But I used to say , `` Take care -- the town is large , there are plenty of bad people in it -- keep a sharp eye on Jem . ''
And so it happened ; for one day an old woman came and bought a lot of things -- more than she could carry ; so my wife , being a kindly soul , lent her the boy , and -- we have never seen him since . '
` And that was seven years ago , you say ? '
` Yes , seven years : we had him cried -- we went from house to house .
Many knew the pretty boy , and were fond of him , but it was all in vain .
No one seemed to know the old woman who bought the vegetables either ; only one old woman , who is ninety years old , said it might have been the fairy Herbaline , who came into the town once in every fifty years to buy things . '
As his father spoke , things grew clearer to Jem's mind , and he saw now that he had not been dreaming , but had really served the old woman seven years in the shape of a squirrel .
As he thought it over rage filled his heart .
Seven years of his youth had been stolen from him , and what had he got in return ?
To learn to rub up cocoa nuts , and to polish glass floors , and to be taught cooking by guinea pigs !
He stood there thinking , till at last his father asked him : ` Is there anything I can do for you , young gentleman ?
Shall I make you a pair of slippers , or perhaps ' with a smile -- ' a case for your nose ? '
` What have you to do with my nose ? '
asked Jem .
` And why should I want a case for it ? '
` Well , everyone to his taste , ' replied the cobbler ; ` but I must say if I had such a nose I would have a nice red leather cover made for it .
Here is a nice piece ; and think what a protection it would be to you .
As it is , you must be constantly knocking up against things . '
The lad was dumb with fright .
He felt his nose .
It was thick , and quite two hands long .
So , then , the old woman had changed his shape , and that was why his own mother did not know him , and called him a horrid dwarf !
` Master , ' said he , ` have you got a glass that I could see myself in ? '
` Young gentleman , ' was the answer , ` your appearance is hardly one to be vain of , and there is no need to waste your time looking in a glass .
Besides , I have none here , and if you must have one you had better ask Urban the barber , who lives over the way , to lend you his .
Good morning . '
So saying , he gently pushed Jem into the street , shut the door , and went back to his work .
Jem stepped across to the barber , whom he had known in old days .
` Good morning , Urban , ' said he ; ` may I look at myself in your glass for a moment ? '
` With pleasure , ' said the barber , laughing , and all the people in his shop fell to laughing also .
` You are a pretty youth , with your swan-like neck and white hands and small nose .
No wonder you are rather vain ; but look as long as you like at yourself . '
So spoke the barber , and a titter ran round the room .
Meantime Jem had stepped up to the mirror , and stood gazing sadly at his reflection .
Tears came to his eyes .
` No wonder you did not know your child again , dear mother , ' thought he ; ` he wasn't like this when you were so proud of his looks . '
His eyes had grown quite small , like pigs ' eyes , his nose was huge and hung down over his mouth and chin , his throat seemed to have disappeared altogether , and his head was fixed stiffly between his shoulders .
He was no taller than he had been seven years ago , when he was not much more than twelve years old , but he made up in breadth , and his back and chest had grown into lumps like two great sacks .
His legs were small and spindly , but his arms were as large as those of a well-grown man , with large brown hands , and long skinny fingers .
Then he remembered the morning when he had first seen the old woman , and her threats to him , and without saying a word he left the barber's shop .
He determined to go again to his mother , and found her still in the market-place .
He begged her to listen quietly to him , and he reminded her of the day when he went away with the old woman , and of many things in his childhood , and told her how the fairy had bewitched him , and he had served her seven years .
Hannah did not know what to think -- the story was so strange ; and it seemed impossible to think her pretty boy and this hideous dwarf were the same .
At last she decided to go and talk to her husband about it .
She gathered up her baskets , told Jem to follow her , and went straight to the cobbler's stall .
` Look here , ' said she , ` this creature says he is our lost son .
He has been telling me how he was stolen seven years ago , and bewitched by a fairy . '
` Indeed ! '
interrupted the cobbler angrily .
` Did he tell you this ?
Wait a minute , you rascal !
Why I told him all about it myself only an hour ago , and then he goes off to humbug you .
So you were bewitched , my son were you ?
Wait a bit , and I'll bewitch you ! '
So saying , he caught up a bundle of straps , and hit out at Jem so hard that he ran off crying .
The poor little dwarf roamed about all the rest of the day without food or drink , and at night was glad to lie down and sleep on the steps of a church .
He woke next morning with the first rays of light , and began to think what he could do to earn a living .
Suddenly he remembered that he was an excellent cook , and he determined to look out for a place .
As soon as it was quite daylight he set out for the palace , for he knew that the grand duke who reigned over the country was fond of good things .
When he reached the palace all the servants crowded about him , and made fun of him , and at last their shouts and laughter grew so loud that the head steward rushed out , crying , ` For goodness sake , be quiet , can't you .
Don't you know his highness is still asleep ? '
Some of the servants ran off at once , and others pointed out Jem .
Indeed , the steward found it hard to keep himself from laughing at the comic sight , but he ordered the servants off and led the dwarf into his own room .
When he heard him ask for a place as cook , he said : ` You make some mistake , my lad .
I think you want to be the grand duke's dwarf , don't you ? '
` No , sir , ' replied Jem . '
I am an experienced cook , and if you will kindly take me to the head cook he may find me of some use . '
` Well , as you will ; but believe me , you would have an easier place as the grand ducal dwarf . '
So saying , the head steward led him to the head cook's room .
` Sir , ' asked Jem , as he bowed till his nose nearly touched the floor , ` do you want an experienced cook ? '
The head cook looked him over from head to foot , and burst out laughing .
` You a cook !
Do you suppose our cooking stoves are so low that you can look into any saucepan on them ?
Oh , my dear little fellow , whoever sent you to me wanted to make fun of you . '
But the dwarf was not to be put off .
` What matters an extra egg or two , or a little butter or flour and spice more or less , in such a house as this ? '
said he .
` Name any dish you wish to have cooked , and give me the materials I ask for , and you shall see . '
He said much more , and at last persuaded the head cook to give him a trial .
They went into the kitchen -- a huge place with at least twenty fireplaces , always alight .
A little stream of clear water ran through the room , and live fish were kept at one end of it .
Everything in the kitchen was of the best and most beautiful kind , and swarms of cooks and scullions were busy preparing dishes .
When the head cook came in with Jem everyone stood quite still .
` What has his highness ordered for luncheon ? '
asked the head cook .
` Sir , his highness has graciously ordered a Danish soup and red Hamburg dumplings . '
` Good , ' said the head cook .
` Have you heard , and do you feel equal to making these dishes ?
Not that you will be able to make the dumplings , for they are a secret receipt . '
` Is that all ! '
said Jem , who had often made both dishes .
` Nothing easier .
Let me have some eggs , a piece of wild boar , and such and such roots and herbs for the soup ; and as for the dumplings , ' he added in a low voice to the head cook , ' I shall want four different kinds of meat , some wine , a duck's marrow , some ginger , and a herb called heal-well . '
` Why , ' cried the astonished cook , ` where did you learn cooking ?
Yes , those are the exact materials , but we never used the herb heal-well , which , I am sure , must be an improvement . '
And now Jem was allowed to try his hand .
He could not nearly reach up to the kitchen range , but by putting a wide plank on two chairs he managed very well .
All the cooks stood round to look on , and could not help admiring the quick , clever way in which he set to work .
At last , when all was ready , Jem ordered the two dishes to be put on the fire till he gave the word .
Then he began to count : ` One , two , three , ' till he got to five hundred when he cried , ` Now ! '
The saucepans were taken off , and he invited the head cook to taste .
The first cook took a golden spoon , washed and wiped it , and handed it to the head cook , who solemnly approached , tasted the dishes , and smacked his lips over them .
` First rate , indeed ! '
he exclaimed .
` You certainly are a master of the art , little fellow , and the herb heal-well gives a particular relish . '
As he was speaking , the duke's valet came to say that his highness was ready for luncheon , and it was served at once in silver dishes .
The head cook took Jem to his own room , but had hardly had time to question him before he was ordered to go at once to the grand duke .
He hurried on his best clothes and followed the messenger .
The grand duke was looking much pleased .
He had emptied the dishes , and was wiping his mouth as the head cook came in .
` Who cooked my luncheon to-day ? '
asked he . '
I must say your dumplings are always very good ; but I don't think I ever tasted anything so delicious as they were to-day .
Who made them ? '
` It is a strange story , your highness , ' said the cook , and told him the whole matter , which surprised the duke so much that he sent for the dwarf and asked him many questions .
Of course , Jem could not say he had been turned into a squirrel , but he said he was without parents and had been taught cooking by an old woman .
` If you will stay with me , ' said the grand duke , ` you shall have fifty ducats a year , besides a new coat and a couple of pairs of trousers .
You must undertake to cook my luncheon yourself and to direct what I shall have for dinner , and you shall be called assistant head cook . '
Jem bowed to the ground , and promised to obey his new master in all things .
He lost no time in setting to work , and everyone rejoiced at having him in the kitchen , for the duke was not a patient man , and had been known to throw plates and dishes at his cooks and servants if the things served were not quite to his taste .
Now all was changed .
He never even grumbled at anything , had five meals instead of three , thought everything delicious , and grew fatter daily .
And so Jem lived on for two years , much respected and considered , and only saddened when he thought of his parents .
One day passed much like another till the following incident happened .
Dwarf Long Nose -- as he was always called -- made a practice of doing his marketing as much as possible himself , and whenever time allowed went to the market to buy his poultry and fruit .
One morning he was in the goose market , looking for some nice fat geese .
No one thought of laughing at his appearance now ; he was known as the duke's special body cook , and every goose-woman felt honoured if his nose turned her way .
He noticed one woman sitting apart with a number of geese , but not crying or praising them like the rest .
He went up to her , felt and weighed her geese , and , finding them very good , bought three and the cage to put them in , hoisted them on his broad shoulders , and set off on his way back .
As he went , it struck him that two of the geese were gobbling and screaming as geese do , but the third sat quite still , only heaving a deep sigh now and then , like a human being .
` That goose is ill , ' said he ; ' I must make haste to kill and dress her . '
But the goose answered him quite distinctly : ` Squeeze too tight And I'll bite , If my neck a twist you gave I 'd bring you to an early grave . '
Quite frightened , the dwarf set down the cage , and the goose gazed at him with sad wise-looking eyes and sighed again .
` Good gracious ! '
said Long Nose .
` So you can speak , Mistress Goose .
I never should have thought it !
Well , don't be anxious .
I know better than to hurt so rare a bird .
But I could bet you were not always in this plumage -- wasn't I a squirrel myself for a time ? '
` You are right , ' said the goose , ` in supposing I was not born in this horrid shape .
Ah !
no one ever thought that Mimi , the daughter of the great Weatherbold , would be killed for the ducal table . '
` Be quite easy , Mistress Mimi , ' comforted Jem .
` As sure as I 'm an honest man and assistant head cook to his highness , no one shall harm you .
I will make a hutch for you in my own rooms , and you shall be well fed , and I'll come and talk to you as much as I can .
I'll tell all the other cooks that I am fattening up a goose on very special food for the grand duke , and at the first good opportunity I will set you free . '
The goose thanked him with tears in her eyes , and the dwarf kept his word .
He killed the other two geese for dinner , but built a little shed for Mimi in one of his rooms , under the pretence of fattening her under his own eye .
He spent all his spare time talking to her and comforting her , and fed her on all the daintiest dishes .
They confided their histories to each other , and Jem learnt that the goose was the daughter of the wizard Weatherbold , who lived on the island of Gothland .
He fell out with an old fairy , who got the better of him by cunning and treachery , and to revenge herself turned his daughter into a goose and carried her off to this distant place .
When Long Nose told her his story she said : ' I know a little of these matters , and what you say shows me that you are under a herb enchantment -- that is to say , that if you can find the herb whose smell woke you up the spell would be broken . '
This was but small comfort for Jem , for how and where was he to find the herb ?
About this time the grand duke had a visit from a neighbouring prince , a friend of his .
He sent for Long Nose and said to him : ` Now is the time to show what you can really do .
This prince who is staying with me has better dinners than any one except myself , and is a great judge of cooking .
As long as he is here you must take care that my table shall be served in a manner to surprise him constantly .
At the same time , on pain of my displeasure , take care that no dish shall appear twice .
Get everything you wish and spare nothing .
If you want to melt down gold and precious stones , do so .
I would rather be a poor man than have to blush before him . '
The dwarf bowed and answered : ` Your highness shall be obeyed .
I will do all in my power to please you and the prince . '
From this time the little cook was hardly seen except in the kitchen , where , surrounded by his helpers , he gave orders , baked , stewed , flavoured and dished up all manner of dishes .
The prince had been a fortnight with the grand duke , and enjoyed himself mightily .
They ate five times a day , and the duke had every reason to be content with the dwarf's talents , for he saw how pleased his guest looked .
On the fifteenth day the duke sent for the dwarf and presented him to the prince .
` You are a wonderful cook , ' said the prince , ` and you certainly know what is good .
All the time I have been here you have never repeated a dish , and all were excellent .
But tell me why you have never served the queen of all dishes , a Suzeraine Pasty ? '
The dwarf felt frightened , for he had never heard of this Queen of Pasties before .
But he did not lose his presence of mind , and replied : ' I have waited , hoping that your highness ' visit here would last some time , for I proposed to celebrate the last day of your stay with this truly royal dish . '
` Indeed , ' laughed the grand duke ; ` then I suppose you would have waited for the day of my death to treat me to it , for you have never sent it up to me yet .
However , you will have to invent some other farewell dish , for the pasty must be on my table to-morrow . '
` As your highness pleases , ' said the dwarf , and took leave .
But it did not please HIM at all .
The moment of disgrace seemed at hand , for he had no idea how to make this pasty .
He went to his rooms very sad .
As he sat there lost in thought the goose Mimi , who was left free to walk about , came up to him and asked what was the matter ?
When she heard she said : ` Cheer up , my friend .
I know the dish quite well : we often had it at home , and I can guess pretty well how it was made . '
Then she told him what to put in , adding : ' I think that will be all right , and if some trifle is left out perhaps they won't find it out . '
Sure enough , next day a magnificent pasty all wreathed round with flowers was placed on the table .
Jem himself put on his best clothes and went into the dining hall .
As he entered the head carver was in the act of cutting up the pie and helping the duke and his guests .
The grand duke took a large mouthful and threw up his eyes as he swallowed it .
` Oh !
oh !
this may well be called the Queen of Pasties , and at the same time my dwarf must be called the king of cooks .
Don't you think so , dear friend ? '
The prince took several small pieces , tasted and examined carefully , and then said with a mysterious and sarcastic smile : ` The dish is very nicely made , but the Suzeraine is not quite complete -- as I expected . '
The grand duke flew into a rage .
` Dog of a cook , ' he shouted ; ` how dare you serve me so ?
I've a good mind to chop off your great head as a punishment . '
` For mercy's sake , don't , your highness !
I made the pasty according to the best rules ; nothing has been left out .
Ask the prince what else I should have put in . '
The prince laughed . '
I was sure you could not make this dish as well as my cook , friend Long Nose .
Know , then , that a herb is wanting called Relish , which is not known in this country , but which gives the pasty its peculiar flavour , and without which your master will never taste it to perfection . '
The grand duke was more furious than ever .
` But I WILL taste it to perfection , ' he roared .
` Either the pasty must be made properly to-morrow or this rascal's head shall come off .
Go , scoundrel , I give you twenty-four hours respite . '
The poor dwarf hurried back to his room , and poured out his grief to the goose .
` Oh , is that all , ' said she , ` then I can help you , for my father taught me to know all plants and herbs .
Luckily this is a new moon just now , for the herb only springs up at such times .
But tell me , are there chestnut trees near the palace ? '
` Oh , yes ! '
cried Long Nose , much relieved ; ` near the lake -- only a couple of hundred yards from the palace -- is a large clump of them .
But why do you ask ? '
` Because the herb only grows near the roots of chestnut trees , ' replied Mimi ; ` so let us lose no time in finding it .
Take me under your arm and put me down out of doors , and I'll hunt for it . '
He did as she bade , and as soon as they were in the garden put her on the ground , when she waddled off as fast as she could towards the lake , Jem hurrying after her with an anxious heart , for he knew that his life depended on her success .
The goose hunted everywhere , but in vain .
She searched under each chestnut tree , turning every blade of grass with her bill -- nothing to be seen , and evening was drawing on !
Suddenly the dwarf noticed a big old tree standing alone on the other side of the lake .
` Look , ' cried he , ` let us try our luck there . '
The goose fluttered and skipped in front , and he ran after as fast as his little legs could carry him .
The tree cast a wide shadow , and it was almost dark beneath it , but suddenly the goose stood still , flapped her wings with joy , and plucked something , which she held out to her astonished friend , saying : ` There it is , and there is more growing here , so you will have no lack of it . '
The dwarf stood gazing at the plant .
It gave out a strong sweet scent , which reminded him of the day of his enchantment .
The stems and leaves were a bluish green , and it bore a dark , bright red flower with a yellow edge .
` What a wonder ! '
cried Long Nose . '
I do believe this is the very herb which changed me from a squirrel into my present miserable form .
Shall I try an experiment ? '
` Not yet , ' said the goose .
` Take a good handful of the herb with you , and let us go to your rooms .
We will collect all your money and clothes together , and then we will test the powers of the herb . '
So they went back to Jem's rooms , and here he gathered together some fifty ducats he had saved , his clothes and shoes , and tied them all up in a bundle .
Then he plunged his face into the bunch of herbs , and drew in their perfume .
As he did so , all his limbs began to crack and stretch ; he felt his head rising above his shoulders ; he glanced down at his nose , and saw it grow smaller and smaller ; his chest and back grew flat , and his legs grew long .
The goose looked on in amazement .
` Oh , how big and how beautiful you are ! '
she cried .
` Thank heaven , you are quite changed . '
Jem folded his hands in thanks , as his heart swelled with gratitude .
But his joy did not make him forget all he owed to his friend Mimi . '
I owe you my life and my release , ' he said , ` for without you I should never have regained my natural shape , and , indeed , would soon have been beheaded .
I will now take you back to your father , who will certainly know how to disenchant you . '
The goose accepted his offer with joy , and they managed to slip out of the palace unnoticed by anyone .
They got through the journey without accident , and the wizard soon released his daughter , and loaded Jem with thanks and valuable presents .
He lost no time in hastening back to his native town , and his parents were very ready to recognise the handsome , well-made young man as their long-lost son .
With the money given him by the wizard he opened a shop , which prospered well , and he lived long and happily .
I must not forget to mention that much disturbance was caused in the palace by Jem's sudden disappearance , for when the grand duke sent orders next day to behead the dwarf , if he had not found the necessary herbs , the dwarf was not to be found .
The prince hinted that the duke had allowed his cook to escape , and had therefore broken his word .
The matter ended in a great war between the two princes , which was known in history as the ` Herb War . '
After many battles and much loss of life , a peace was at last concluded , and this peace became known as the ` Pasty Peace , ' because at the banquet given in its honour the prince's cook dished up the Queen of Pasties -- the Suzeraine -- and the grand duke declared it to be quite excellent .
