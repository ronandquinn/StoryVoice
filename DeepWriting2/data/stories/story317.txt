I had been reading a ghost story to Mrs. Sefton , and I laid it down at the end with a little shrug of contempt .
`` What utter nonsense ! ''
I said .
Mrs. Sefton nodded abstractedly above her fancywork .
`` That is .
It is a very commonplace story indeed .
I don't believe the spirits of the departed trouble themselves to revisit the glimpses of the moon for the purpose of frightening honest mortals -- or even for the sake of hanging around the favourite haunts of their existence in the flesh .
If they ever appear , it must be for a better reason than that . ''
`` You don't surely think that they ever do appear ? ''
I said incredulously .
`` We have no proof that they do not , my dear . ''
`` Surely , Mary , '' I exclaimed , `` you don't mean to say that you believe people ever do or can see spirits -- ghosts , as the word goes ? ''
`` I didn't say I believed it .
I never saw anything of the sort .
I neither believe nor disbelieve .
But you know queer things do happen at times -- things you can't account for .
At least , people who you know wouldn't lie say so .
Of course , they may be mistaken .
And I don't think that everybody can see spirits either , provided they are to be seen .
It requires people of a certain organization -- with a spiritual eye , as it were .
We haven't all got that -- in fact , I think very few of us have .
I dare say you think I 'm talking nonsense . ''
`` Well , yes , I think you are .
You really surprise me , Mary .
I always thought you the least likely person in the world to take up with such ideas .
Something must have come under your observation to develop such theories in your practical head .
Tell me what it was . ''
`` To what purpose ?
You would remain as sceptical as ever . ''
`` Possibly not .
Try me ; I may be convinced . ''
`` No , '' returned Mrs. Sefton calmly .
`` Nobody ever is convinced by hearsay .
When a person has once seen a spirit -- or thinks he has -- he thenceforth believes it .
And when somebody else is intimately associated with that person and knows all the circumstances -- well , he admits the possibility , at least .
That is my position .
But by the time it gets to the third person -- the outsider -- it loses power .
Besides , in this particular instance the story isn't very exciting .
But then -- it's true . ''
`` You have excited my curiosity .
You must tell me the story . ''
`` Well , first tell me what you think of this .
Suppose two people , both sensitively organized individuals , loved each other with a love stronger than life .
If they were apart , do you think it might be possible for their souls to communicate with each other in some inexplicable way ?
And if anything happened to one , don't you think that that one could and would let the spirit of the other know ? ''
`` You 're getting into too deep waters for me , Mary , '' I said , shaking my head .
`` I 'm not an authority on telepathy , or whatever you call it .
But I've no belief in such theories .
In fact , I think they are all nonsense .
I 'm sure you must think so too in your rational moments . ''
`` I dare say it is all nonsense , '' said Mrs. Sefton slowly , `` but if you had lived a whole year in the same house with Miriam Gordon , you would have been tainted too .
Not that she had ` theories ' -- at least , she never aired them if she had .
But there was simply something about the girl herself that gave a person strange impressions .
When I first met her I had the most uncanny feeling that she was all spirit -- soul -- what you will !
no flesh , anyhow .
That feeling wore off after a while , but she never seemed like other people to me .
`` She was Mr. Sefton's niece .
Her father had died when she was a child .
When Miriam was twenty her mother had married a second time and went to Europe with her husband .
Miriam came to live with us while they were away .
Upon their return she was herself to be married .
`` I had never seen Miriam before .
Her arrival was unexpected , and I was absent from home when she came .
I returned in the evening , and when I saw her first she was standing under the chandelier in the drawing room .
Talk about spirits !
For five seconds I thought I had seen one .
`` Miriam was a beauty .
I had known that before , though I think I hardly expected to see such wonderful loveliness .
She was tall and extremely graceful , dark -- at least her hair was dark , but her skin was wonderfully fair and clear .
Her hair was gathered away from her face , and she had a high , pure , white forehead , and the straightest , finest , blackest brows .
Her face was oval , with very large and dark eyes .
`` I soon realized that Miriam was in some mysterious fashion different from other people .
I think everyone who met her felt the same way .
Yet it was a feeling hard to define .
For my own part I simply felt as if she belonged to another world , and that part of the time she -- her soul , you know -- was back there again .
`` You must not suppose that Miriam was a disagreeable person to have in the house .
On the contrary , it was the very reverse .
Everybody liked her .
She was one of the sweetest , most winsome girls I ever knew , and I soon grew to love her dearly .
As for what Dick called her ` little queernesses ' -- well , we got used to them in time .
`` Miriam was engaged , as I have told you , to a young Harvard man named Sidney Claxton .
I knew she loved him very deeply .
When she showed me his photograph , I liked his appearance and said so .
Then I made some teasing remark about her love-letters -- just for a joke , you know .
Miriam looked at me with an odd little smile and said quickly : '' ` Sidney and I never write to each other . ' ''
` Why , Miriam ! '
I exclaimed in astonishment .
` Do you mean to tell me you never hear from him at all ? ' ''
` No , I did not say that .
I hear from him every day -- every hour .
We do not need to write letters .
There are better means of communication between two souls that are in perfect accord with each other . ' ''
` Miriam , you uncanny creature , what do you mean ? '
I asked .
`` But Miriam only gave another queer smile and made no answer at all .
Whatever her beliefs or theories were , she would never discuss them .
`` She had a habit of dropping into abstracted reveries at any time or place .
No matter where she was , this , whatever it was , would come over her .
She would sit there , perhaps in the centre of a gay crowd , and gaze right out into space , not hearing or seeing a single thing that went on around her .
`` I remember one day in particular ; we were sewing in my room .
I looked up and saw that Miriam's work had dropped on her knee and she was leaning forward , her lips apart , her eyes gazing upward with an unearthly expression . ''
` Don't look like that , Miriam ! '
I said , with a little shiver .
` You seem to be looking at something a thousand miles away ! '
`` Miriam came out of her trance or reverie and said , with a little laugh : '' ` How do you know but that I was ? '
`` She bent her head for a minute or two .
Then she lifted it again and looked at me with a sudden contraction of her level brows that betokened vexation . '' '
I wish you hadn't spoken to me just then , ' she said .
` You interrupted the message I was receiving .
I shall not get it at all now . ' ''
` Miriam , ' I implored . '
I so wish my dear girl , that you wouldn't talk so .
It makes people think there is something queer about you .
Who in the world was sending you a message , as you call it ? ' ''
` Sidney , ' said Miriam simply . ''
` Nonsense ! ' ''
` You think it is nonsense because you don't understand it , ' was her calm response .
`` I recall another event was when some caller dropped in and we had drifted into a discussion about ghosts and the like -- and I've no doubt we all talked some delicious nonsense .
Miriam said nothing at the time , but when we were alone I asked her what she thought of it . '' '
I thought you were all merely talking against time , ' she retorted evasively . ''
` But , Miriam , do you really think it is possible for ghosts -- ' '' ' I detest that word ! ' ''
` Well , spirits then -- to return after death , or to appear to anyone apart from the flesh ? ' '' '
I will tell you what I know .
If anything were to happen to Sidney -- if he were to die or be killed -- he would come to me himself and tell me . '
`` One day Miriam came down to lunch looking pale and worried .
After Dick went out , I asked her if anything were wrong . ''
` Something has happened to Sidney , ' she replied , ` some painful accident -- I don't know what . ' ''
` How do you know ? '
I cried .
Then , as she looked at me strangely , I added hastily , ` You haven't been receiving any more unearthly messages , have you ?
Surely , Miriam , you are not so foolish as to really believe in that ! ' '' '
I know , ' she answered quickly .
` Belief or disbelief has nothing to do with it .
Yes , I have had a message .
I know that some accident has happened to Sidney -- painful and inconvenient but not particularly dangerous .
I do not know what it is .
Sidney will write me that .
He writes when it is absolutely necessary . ' ''
` Aerial communication isn't perfected yet then ? '
I said mischievously .
But , observing how really worried she seemed , I added , ` Don't fret , Miriam .
You may be mistaken . '
`` Well , two days afterwards she got a note from her lover -- the first I had ever known her to receive -- in which he said he had been thrown from his horse and had broken his left arm .
It had happened the very morning Miriam received her message .
`` Miriam had been with us about eight months when one day she came into my room hurriedly .
She was very pale . ''
` Sidney is ill -- dangerously ill .
What shall I do ? '
`` I knew she must have had another of those abominable messages -- or thought she had -- and really , remembering the incident of the broken arm , I couldn't feel as sceptical as I pretended to .
I tried to cheer her , but did not succeed .
Two hours later she had a telegram from her lover's college chum , saying that Mr. Claxton was dangerously ill with typhoid fever .
`` I was quite alarmed about Miriam in the days that followed .
She grieved and fretted continually .
One of her troubles was that she received no more messages ; she said it was because Sidney was too ill to send them .
Anyhow , she had to content herself with the means of communication used by ordinary mortals .
`` Sidney's mother , who had gone to nurse him , wrote every day , and at last good news came .
The crisis was over and the doctor in attendance thought Sidney would recover .
Miriam seemed like a new creature then , and rapidly recovered her spirits .
`` For a week reports continued favourable .
One night we went to the opera to hear a celebrated prima donna .
When we returned home Miriam and I were sitting in her room , chatting over the events of the evening .
`` Suddenly she sat straight up with a sort of convulsive shudder , and at the same time -- you may laugh if you like -- the most horrible feeling came over me .
I didn't see anything , but I just felt that there was something or someone in the room besides ourselves .
`` Miriam was gazing straight before her .
She rose to her feet and held out her hands . ''
` Sidney ! '
she said .
`` Then she fell to the floor in a dead faint .
`` I screamed for Dick , rang the bell and rushed to her .
`` In a few minutes the whole household was aroused , and Dick was off posthaste for the doctor , for we could not revive Miriam from her death-like swoon .
She seemed as one dead .
We worked over her for hours .
She would come out of her faint for a moment , give us an unknowing stare and go shudderingly off again .
`` The doctor talked of some fearful shock , but I kept my own counsel .
At dawn Miriam came back to life at last .
When she and I were left alone , she turned to me . ''
` Sidney is dead , ' she said quietly . '
I saw him -- just before I fainted .
I looked up , and he was standing between me and you .
He had come to say farewell . '
`` What could I say ?
Almost while we were talking a telegram came .
He was dead -- he had died at the very hour at which Miriam had seen him . ''
Mrs. Sefton paused , and the lunch bell rang .
`` What do you think of it ? ''
she queried as we rose .
`` Honestly , I don't know what I think of it , '' I answered frankly .
