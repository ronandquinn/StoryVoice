Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat .
Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?
You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''
`` So it does .
It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come .
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air .
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it can't be helped . ''
`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples .
`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse .
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests .
`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared .
`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line .
We can't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''
So the same old list it was .
But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled .
`` We can't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances .
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma .
`` Can't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you .
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school .
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her .
She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''
`` And so shy , '' said Alma .
`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her .
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and doesn't seem to have anyone belonging to her .
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances .
`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously .
`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake .
I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one .
But there , I shall not preach .
This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''
Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes .
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls .
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light .
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?
Her landlady met her in the hall .
`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price .
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself .
`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly .
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
`` My errand won't take very long , '' said Frances brightly .
`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement .
We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town .
You'll come , won't you ? ''
`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise .
`` I shall be very glad to go .
Why , it is so nice to think of it .
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze .
`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''
That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price's when I asked her up .
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
She reminded me so much of somebody I've seen , but I can't think who it is .
I 'm so glad we've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it .
Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever .
Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train .
After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen .
`` I've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range .
`` It's Max Seeley .
You needn't laugh , Al. .
It's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
He's plump and prosperous and she's pinched and pale , but there's a resemblance nevertheless .
Look for yourself and see if it isn't so . ''
Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways .
Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge .
Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed .
`` You will excuse me , won't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''
he said eagerly .
`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her .
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so .
But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum .
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
I had a happy home with her , although we were poor .
Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so .
She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it .
She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world .
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case .
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case .
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said .
`` My name is Maxwell Seeley .
My father died when I was seven years old , and my mother a year later .
My little sister , Bertha , then three years old , and I were left quite alone and very poor .
We had no relatives .
I was adopted by a well-to-do old bachelor , who had known my father .
My sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away .
I was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting .
My adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education .
I did not forget my sister , and as soon as I could I went to the asylum .
I found that she had been taken away long before , and I could not even discover who had adopted her , for the original building , with all its records , had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit .
I never could find any clue to her whereabouts , and long since gave up all hope of finding her .
But I have found her at last .
You are Bertha Seeley , my little sister ! ''
`` Oh -- can it be possible ! ''
`` More than possible -- it is certain .
You are the image of my mother , as I remember her , and as an old daguerreotype I have pictures her .
And this is her watch -- see , I scratched my own initials on the case one day .
There is no doubt in the world .
Oh , Bertha , are you half as glad as I am ? ''
`` Glad ! ''
Bertha's eyes were shining like stars .
She tried to smile , but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brother's shoulder .
By this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau , and Ernest , coming through the hall , gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings .
`` I haven't suddenly gone crazy , Ernest , old fellow , '' smiled Max .
`` Ladies and gentlemen all , this little school-ma ` am was introduced to you as Miss Price , but that was a mistake .
Let me introduce her again as Miss Bertha Seeley , my long-lost and newly-found sister . ''
Well they had an amazing time then , of course .
They laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone-cold on the dining-room table .
Luckily , Alma and Frances remembered it just in the nick of time , and they all got out , somehow , and into their places .
It was a splendid dinner , but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley didn't know what they were eating , any more than if it had been sawdust .
However , the rest of the guests made up for that , and did full justice to the girls ' cookery .
In the afternoon they all went to church , and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day .
When the dusk came , Ernest and Maxwell had to catch the last train for town , and the other guests went home , with the exception of Bertha , who was to stay all night .
Just as soon as her resignation could be effected , she was to join her brother .
`` Meanwhile , I'll see about getting a house to put you in , '' said Max .
`` No more boarding out for me , Ernest .
You may consider me as a family man henceforth . ''
Frances and Alma talked it all over before they went to sleep that night .
`` Just think , '' said Frances , `` if we hadn't asked her here today she might never have found her brother !
It's all Mother's doing , bless her !
Things do happen like a storybook sometimes , don't they , Al ?
