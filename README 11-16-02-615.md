# StoryVoice - Ronan Quinn D15124865

StoryVoice is my DIT DT255/3 Ordinary Degree project
It is designed to be amachine learning, trained model,
for generating original childrens stories, which are then
read aloud by the Google AIY voice kit. The system then
offers the capability of saving stories to be retold

The project is divided into 2 distinct directories, intended to be installed on separate platforms

gcpInstance is installed on a Google Cloud vm instance

aiyUI is installed on a Google AIY voice kit
